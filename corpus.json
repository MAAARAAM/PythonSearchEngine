        "Titre": "The Spin | ‘Deep, minging, unpleasant’: cricket’s flooding problem is getting worse",
        "Auteur": "Tanya Aldred",
        "Date": "2025-01-08",
        "Texte": "The water started flowing into the New Road practice area at about 4pm on Monday afternoon, and just kept on rolling. It flooded the entire ground and half the car park, as well as the nearby racecourse, the rowing club and the public footpath – which is now a popular hang-out space for swans. The head groundsman, Stephen Manfield, a man of a remarkably perky disposition, sits on the balcony of the club’s sports bar watching the fourth flood of the off-season do its business, the water coming in from the burst banks of the Severn as well as round the back across the fields. For the benefit of Spin readers he pokes his measuring stick into the water – “four and a half feet in the shallow end”, and still rising. Last off-season New Road was flooded eight times (enough for the chief executive, Ashley Giles, to question the long-term viability of the club), and the 2024-25 winter is tracking in a similar way. Most floods last nine to 10 days, though this is the highest since Worcestershire’s end-of-season party in September. Manfield stirs the murky water. “It is deep, it is minging, it is unpleasant, but is my job and I love it.” Worcestershire CCC are not alone. Dan Musson, the head of facilities planning at the England and Wales Cricket Board, has been in touch with 27 clubs so far this storm season, and he is expecting to hear from many more this week as a result of the new year floods and the subsequent snow fall and melt. It is still some way short of 2015-16, the worst year to date, when storms Desmond and Eva blew in and more than 60 clubs were significantly affected, but he’s not making any assumptions. In December, the Environment Agency published its updated picture of current and future flood and coastal erosion risk in England. It isn’t a pretty read. Climate projections suggest one in four of all homes will be at risk by 2050, along with 46% of the road network, 54% of the railway network, 34% of water pumping stations and 18% of agricultural land. Cricket clubs do not have a magic escape route. A third of recreational clubs are now at risk of flooding, and that number is likely to rise in tune with everything else. Ross on Wye CC are one example. The club are on a flood plain – and historically would have expected to flood once every four to five years. They’ve been under water three times since September – a combination of volume of water and blocked drainage culverts (about which they are in dispute with the council). The ECB has emergency funding available for those who need it (contact facilities@ecb.co.uk) but the most important thing, Musson urges, is for clubs to register for flood alerts and to make a flood plan. “The key is to identify risk, create a plan, and work out what actions you will take in the event of a flood and who might take those actions. This might be as simple as moving expensive equipment to a safer place at the end of the season, to longer term projects like sandbagging and flood-proofing buildings.” Flood proofing is often very expensive and difficult to carry out, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. In many cases, although a club’s building may not be at risk, the pitch is, and Musson stresses the importance of maintaining culverts and drains so that water can escape. “Often the key is how quickly the water recedes and if there is appropriate drainage and if it is working properly.” Outside emergency funding, clubs can also apply for flood resilience and protection money through the ECB’s County Grant Funds under the Tackling Climate Change theme. “The impact of climate change affects every club,” says Musson. “Flooding will be the biggest risk to certain clubs in certain parts of the country, but other clubs in other parts of the country are more at risk of drought, and we have even had clubs flooded in areas where a drought order is in place. Essentially, climate change and weather related climactic events can affect clubs in very different ways but across water use, drought risk, flood risk and energy (including carbon reduction) everyone is impacted.” Corbridge CC, on the banks of the Tyne, were one of those clubs hit by Storm Desmond, the ground inundated with six feet of water after the river rose 24 feet in 20 hours. Their clubhouse was destroyed and they rebuilt two separate buildings: a changing room made out of breeze block and concrete, which is easy to swill out, with electric sockets lifted more than a metre up the walls, and a separate social pavilion that is raised up off the ground. It is a lovely building, and its elevated height makes it fantastic to watch cricket from, but it was hard graft and an expensive business, with funding from the ECB, Northumberland county council, insurance, charitable trusts and private donations. And, as Musson is evangelical in pointing out, planning is the cheapest thing you can do, as is making sure you are insured, though that is becoming harder as insurers become more canny about flood risk. In those cases, Musson says, “then it becomes all about how you build resilience and weather the experience of flooding. And Worcester is the prime example of that.” Back then to Manfield and his wellington boots and smelly water. “It’s just disheartening that it is here again,” he says, as he gives a video tour of the flood, “but it is my lot in life now, I think I should grow flippers.” This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

        "Texte": "Rail, sail and learn to surf in Portrush, County Antrim We took the train to Birkenhead then overnight ferry (new Stena boat with four-berth cabin for £229) to Belfast. The Translink train whisked us to Portrush (£54 for family of five). Arriving in centre of town allowed easy walking to accommodation and the surf beach. The Alive Adventures instructors were fantastic, entertaining kids in all weather conditions and providing snug c-skin wetsuits to prevent cold. Afternoons were spent using the frequent Causeway Rambler bus along the beautiful Antrim coastline. David Williams Spotting puffins and gulls on Skomer, Pembrokeshire Spending two nights with our two young children on Skomer Island off the coast of Wales was an unforgettable experience. The island, known for seabirds such as puffins and razorbills, offered a unique opportunity to get hands-on with nature. We joined researchers in tagging baby Manx shearwaters, learning how their efforts help protect these birds. The children loved gently holding the chicks and seeing conservation in action. We also participated in an evening birdwatching survey, spotting puffins and gulls. Those two days deepened our appreciation for wildlife, and left us with lasting memories of this magical island. My tip? Stay overnight to fully experience the magic of the island. Clare Baskott Sing your heart out in Florence I am easily the worst singer in my family, so when I stumbled on an international group learning how to sing a cappella in a church in Florence last summer, I decided to join them for the week – and my children and wife encouraged me. The sessions were fascinating. In a simple but beautiful Renaissance church overlooking the River Arno, I learned about the history of a cappella (literally of the chapel, as it’s a kind of choral church music), did relaxation and breathing exercises to warm up, and practised some basic songs. The course also taught me how to do vocal harmonies with others. I certainly feel a better singer for it – and I’m told off much less now for exercising my vocal cords at home! Joe Write where the Brontë sisters were inspired, West Yorkshire I can’t think of a better place to attend a creative writing course than Arvon Lumb Bank near Hebden Bridge. If the course is not an inspiration, the setting certainly is. It’s the former home of poet Ted Hughes, and his wife, Sylvia Plath, is buried across the valley in the churchyard at Heptonstall. Walk across the moors at the top of the valley and you will reach Top Withens, the farmhouse (now ruined) which inspired Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. Dropping down from there, you reach Haworth and the Brontë Parsonage. Lumb Bank reopens in 2025 after a refurbishment, so go and be inspired to write your own great poem or novel. Chris Allen Scuba diving in Malta Looking up at the sun’s rays permeating the surface of the sea is a lesson like no other. The Maltese island of Gozo offered me the chance to learn to scuba dive in the Mediterranean at Bubbles Dive Centre. The three-day course teaches basic safety skills before you take to the water for practical lessons that enable students to become Padi-certified open water scuba divers. After qualifying, you will embark on a recreational dive. Ours took us along a narrow creek in the breathtaking Għasri Valley, surfacing in Cathedral Cave, where we admired the luminous blue lighting and natural beauty. T Miller Painting Irish coastal landscapes Having never taken an art class at school, (my father insisting that three years of Latin would be more beneficial), I finally signed up for a three-day Artform workshop with Neal Greig as instructor in beautiful Dunmore East, County Waterford. While I’m no Cézanne, I developed a love of oils and textures, necessary tools to depict Irish coastal landscapes. It’s a world away from my day job working in IT, but those few days have left me dreaming of retiring to a studio with nothing more than an easel and the sea. Aoife Mac Cana Surf’s up in Portugal I had a fantastic time at Peniche Surf Lodge in September. For £385, I had seven nights in a single room, with shared bathroom. Being a hostel, all the guests are keen to get to know one other. Also included is seven days of surfboard rental and five in-water coaching sessions. Duncan and Dane Hall are the coaches – Dane is ex-pro. Every day after breakfast, we’d load up the people carriers and head to the beach where the family would set up a beach camp for us, including blankets, windbreaks and cushions. Paddy G Cooking in Spain I spent five days in Moclin, Andalucía, with Granada Cultural Holidays, to learn how to cook local dishes. The course was hands-on, as we prepared all our meals as well as tapas for 50 guests. Having expressed an interest in tortilla, I peeled and sculpted 2kg of potatoes and learned that you can never use too much olive oil. The drained potatoes were mixed with 12 eggs and after cooking, I flipped the huge tortilla out and back into the heavy cast iron pan under the gaze of my fellow students. Everyone wanted to try the result, and I ended up making more for the guests. Roy Messenger Snorkelling with sharks off Cornwall One of the most exhilarating moments of my life has to be seeing a sleek silvery blue shark just below me in the water. We caught a boat with Blue Shark Snorkel from Penzance and travelled 10-20 miles out to sea, where the knowledgeable crew tell you everything you might want to know about these sharks. Once you convince yourself to slip from the safety of the boat into the water, snorkelling is a great lesson in controlling your fear. But you gradually learn to calm your heart rate, keep your face in the water and then every glimpse of these beautiful creatures is a joy. Sukie Winning tip: sculpting by the seaside in Dorset The Isle of Portland may be best known for Chesil Beach, but it captivated my heart as the backdrop for an extraordinary week-long stone sculpture course with the Portland Sculpture and Quarry Trust. Led by an inspiring artist couple, Hannah and Paul, I was guided through the process of hand carving to coax an artistically dubious bird bath from a huge lump of fossil-filled Portland stone. Each day ended with a rejuvenating swim to wash away dust and sweat in Church Ope Cove, believed to be the site of Britain’s first-ever Viking attack, before falling into bed at my hostel in an old lighthouse. I returned to London with hands raw from polishing coarse stone and full of admiration for the craftspeople behind the many Portland stone buildings and carvings that adorn this city. Catherine"

        "Texte": "Career success often resembles an adventure rather than a straight, predictable path. Pursuing our passions while navigating life’s ups and downs is rarely smooth. A key factor in overcoming obstacles is having support. The career path of Holly Thompson, a supervisor of zoology at Perth Zoo and a Murdoch University alumnus, illustrates the impact that a supportive institution can have. Once a student with average grades, she is now a 2024 Churchill fellow, thanks in part to the opportunities and flexibility provided by Murdoch. “It was instilled in me from a young age to be curious and open to continuous development,” she says. “This attitude has been consistently encouraged through my experiences at Murdoch University.” A university of difference Holly Thompson. Photo supplied. Since opening its doors in 1974, Murdoch University has championed social equity and fostered a community that supports all people as they bid to reach their potential. As the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Andrew Deeks, puts it: “Murdoch University has been a university of difference since its foundation.” Sustainability, inclusivity, and respect for First Nations perspectives are principles intrinsic to every aspect of Murdoch’s teaching and research. The first Australian university to introduce flexible admissions that considered factors beyond academic results, Murdoch has always had a forward-thinking and optimistic approach to education. Pathways for ambition Thompson knows better than most how challenges can be overcome with the right support. She always wanted a career in wildlife conservation, despite initial discouragement. “I didn’t have the best grades in school, but I was fuelled by passion and determination,” she says. Despite initial setbacks, Thompson’s determination to pursue a career in wildlife conservation led her to Murdoch, where programs such as OnTrack Flex, the near-miss ATAR program OnTrack Sprint, and the nationally acclaimed Indigenous enabling program K-Track provide multiple pathways to entry. Thompson was able to enrol in a bachelor of science in conservation and wildlife biology and has never looked back. “The learning environment provided me with the support I needed,” she says. Shortly after starting her degree, Thompson was confronted with an unexpected challenge: she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. At the time, she was balancing her studies with a job at Perth Zoo, and it was a setback that could have discouraged someone less determined or been impossible to manage at a less accommodating institution. “Murdoch was exceptionally supportive during this time and assisted with options such as units at other universities and utilising these to complement my degree,” Thompson says. Today, Thompson puts her degree to use as not only a supervisor of zoology at Perth Zoo but a conservationist working to release orangutans back into the wild and end the illegal pet trade of gibbons. It’s a dream career story that came true thanks to Thompson’s ambition and the university’s sustained commitment to student diversity and inclusion. “I encourage everyone to be proactive in their career, and that starts with study choices,” Thompson says. Diversity in higher education Students come together on Bush Court, the heart of Murdoch University’s Perth campus. Photo supplied. Lisa Annese, the CEO of Diversity Council Australia, highlights the transformative changes that have taken place in Australian higher education. “In the past decade, we’ve seen dramatic changes in the mix of students attending universities in Australia, from gender to socioeconomic status, cultural and racial backgrounds, sexuality and disability status,” she says. “For example, between 2011 and 2021 the number of students from regional areas grew by over 25%, and the number of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander students grew by more than 200%,” Annese says. “Add to this increases in LGBTIQ+ representation, increased women’s participation and improved access for people with disability and it is clear that today’s generation of university students is remarkably diverse.” This diversity is not just beneficial for individual students but for Australia’s labour market. “Diversity in work groups and leadership teams has been linked to better performance, profit, innovation and market share,” Annese says. Supporting future-ready professionals Dr Rebecca Bennett, the pro vice-chancellor of equity, diversity and inclusion at Murdoch University, echoes the importance of diversity within professional sectors, highlighting that it begins with a focus on equity in education. “Fostering an inclusive learning environment that values equity, diversity, and inclusion, we prepare our graduates to be adaptable, empathetic, and innovative professionals,” Bennett says. “These qualities are highly sought after in today’s job market, ensuring that our students are well prepared to make meaningful contributions to their chosen fields and to society at large.” Henry, one of the Murdoch University therapy dogs, with staff at the 2023 Pride Picnic.

Adapting to change and development is an expected part of this process, but with strong institutional support, every student’s unique circumstances are considered to guide them towards fulfilling career outcomes that align with their needs and ambitions. Deeks outlines Murdoch’s commitment. “We are modelling a genuinely inclusive community where everyone can reach their potential,” he says. “The impact of this reverberates far beyond our campuses, as our students go on to forge careers, carrying this experience and an appreciation of the value of community with them.” Bennett says valuing diversity, equity and inclusion is an investment in the future. “At Murdoch,” she says, “we want to produce graduates and professionals who are empowered with the skills and confidence to instigate and direct positive change in society, industry, environment and, ultimately, our shared future.” Thompson’s journey is proof of the power of that.

        "Titre": "The deep historical forces that explain Trump’s win",
        "Auteur": "Peter Turchin",
        "Date": "2024-11-30",
        "Texte": "In the days since the sweeping Republican victory in the US election, which gave the party control of the presidency, the Senate and the House, commentators have analysed and dissected the relative merits of the main protagonists – Kamala Harris and Donald Trump – in minute detail. Much has been said about their personalities and the words they have spoken; little about the impersonal social forces that push complex human societies to the brink of collapse – and sometimes beyond. That’s a mistake: in order to understand the roots of our current crisis, and possible ways out of it, it’s precisely these tectonic forces we need to focus on. The research team I lead studies cycles of political integration and disintegration over the past 5,000 years. We have found that societies, organised as states, can experience significant periods of peace and stability lasting, roughly, a century or so. Inevitably, though, they then enter periods of social unrest and political breakdown. Think of the end of the Roman empire, the English civil war or the Russian Revolution. To date, we have amassed data on hundreds of historical states as they slid into crisis, and then emerged from it. So we’re in a good position to identify just those impersonal social forces that foment unrest and fragmentation, and we’ve found three common factors: popular immiseration, elite overproduction and state breakdown. To get a better understanding of these concepts and how they are influencing American politics in 2024, we need to travel back in time to the 1930s, when an unwritten social contract came into being in the form of Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. This contract balanced the interests of workers, businesses and the state in a way similar to the more formal agreements we see in Nordic countries. For two generations, this implicit pact delivered an unprecedented growth in wellbeing across a broad swath of the country. At the same time, a “Great Compression” of incomes and wealth dramatically reduced economic inequality. For roughly 50 years the interests of workers and the interests of owners were kept in balance, and overall income inequality remained remarkably low. That social contract began to break down in the late 1970s. The power of unions was undermined, and taxes on the wealthy cut back. Typical workers’ wages, which had previously increased in tandem with overall economic growth, started to lag behind. Inflation-adjusted wages stagnated and at times decreased. The result was a decline in many aspects of quality of life for the majority of Americans. One shocking way this became evident was in changes to the average life expectancy, which stalled and even went into reverse (and this started well before the Covid pandemic). That’s what we term “popular immiseration”. With the incomes of workers effectively stuck, the fruits of economic growth were reaped by the elites instead. A perverse “wealth pump” came into being, siphoning money from the poor and channelling it to the rich. The Great Compression reversed itself. In many ways, the last four decades call to mind what happened in the United States between 1870 and 1900 – the time of railroad fortunes and robber barons. If the postwar period was a golden age of broad-based prosperity, after 1980 we could be said to have entered a Second Gilded Age. Welcome as the extra wealth might seem for its recipients, it ends up causing problems for them as a class. The uber-wealthy (those with fortunes greater than $10m) increased tenfold between 1980 and 2020, adjusted for inflation. A certain proportion of these people have political ambitions: some run for political office themselves (like Trump), others fund political candidates (like Peter Thiel). The more members of this elite class there are, the more aspirants for political power a society contains. By the 2010s the social pyramid in the US had grown exceptionally top-heavy: there were too many wannabe leaders and moguls competing for a fixed number of positions in the upper echelons of politics and business. In our model, this state of affairs has a name: elite overproduction. Elite overproduction can be likened to a game of musical chairs – except the number of chairs stays constant, while the number of players is allowed to increase. As the game progresses, it creates more and more angry losers. Some of those turn into “counter-elites”: those willing to challenge the established order; rebels and revolutionaries such as Oliver Cromwell and his Roundheads in the English civil war, or Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia. In the contemporary US we might think of media disruptors such as Tucker Carlson, or maverick entrepreneurs seeking political influence such as Elon Musk alongside countless less-prominent examples at lower levels in the system. As battles between the ruling elites and counter-elites heat up, the norms governing public discourse unravel and trust in institutions declines. The result is a loss of civic cohesiveness and sense of national cooperation – without which states quickly rot from within. One result of all this political dysfunction is an inability to agree on how the federal budget should be balanced. Together with the loss of trust and legitimacy, that accelerates the breakdown of state capacity. It’s notable that a collapse in state finances is often the triggering event for a revolution: this is what happened in France before 1789 and in the runup to the English civil war. How does this landscape translate to party politics? The American ruling class, as it has evolved since the end of the civil war in 1865, is basically a coalition of the top wealth holders (the proverbial 1%) and a highly educated or “credentialed” class of professionals and graduates (whom we might call the 10%). A decade ago, the Republicans were the party of the 1%, while the Democrats were the party of the 10%. Since then, they have both changed out of all recognition. The recasting of the Republican party began with the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in 2016. He was typical of political entrepreneurs in history who have channelled popular discontent to propel themselves to power (one example is Tiberius Gracchus, who founded the populist party in late Republican Rome). Not all of his initiatives went against the interests of the ruling class – for example, he succeeded in making the tax code more regressive. But many did, including his policies on immigration (economic elites tend to favour open immigration as it suppresses wages); a rejection of traditional Republican free-market orthodoxy in favour of industrial policy; a scepticism of Nato and a professed unwillingness to start new conflicts abroad. It seemed to some as though the revolution had been squashed when a quintessentially establishment figure, Joe Biden, defeated Trump in 2020. By 2024 the Democrats had essentially become the party of the ruling class – of the 10% and of the 1%, having tamed its own populist wing (led by the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders). This realignment was signalled by Kamala Harris massively outspending Trump this election cycle, as well as mainstream Republicans, such as Liz and Dick Cheney, or neocons such as Bill Kristol, supporting the Harris ticket. The GOP, in the meantime, has transformed itself into a truly revolutionary party: one that represents working people (according to its leaders) or a radical rightwing agenda (according to its detractors). In the process, it has largely purged itself of traditional Republicans. Trump was clearly the chief agent of this change. But while the mainstream media and politicians obsess over him, it is important to recognise that he is now merely the tip of the iceberg: a diverse group of counter-elites has coalesced around the Trump ticket. Some of them, such as JD Vance, had meteoric rises through the Republican ranks. Some, such as Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, defected from the Democrats. Others include tycoons such as Musk, or media figures, such as Joe Rogan, perhaps the most influential American podcaster. The latter was once a supporter of the populist wing of the Democratic party (and Bernie Sanders in particular). The main point here is that in 2024, the Democrats, having morphed into the party of the ruling class, had to contend not only with the tide of popular discontent but also a revolt of the counter-elites. As such, it finds itself in a predicament that has recurred thousands of times in human history, and there are two ways things play out from here. One is with the overthrow of established elites, as happened in the French and Russian Revolutions. The other is with the ruling elites backing a rebalancing of the social system – most importantly, shutting down the wealth pump and reversing popular immiseration and elite overproduction. It happened about a century ago with the New Deal. There’s also a parallel in the Chartist period (1838–1857), when Great Britain was the only European great power to avoid the wave of revolutions that swept Europe in 1848, via major reform. But the US has so far failed to learn the historical lessons. What comes next? The electoral defeat on 5 November represents one battle in an ongoing revolutionary war. The triumphant counter-elites want to replace their counterparts – what they sometimes call the “deep state” – entirely. But history shows that success in achieving such goals is far from assured. Their opponents are pretty well entrenched in the bureaucracy and can effectively resist change. Ideological and personal tensions in the winning coalition may result in it breaking apart (as they say, revolutions devour their children). Most importantly, the challenges facing the new Trump administration are of the particularly intractable kind. What is their plan for tackling the exploding federal budget deficit? How are they going to shut down the wealth pump? And what will the Democrats’ response be? Will their platform for 2028 include a new New Deal, a commitment to major social reform? One thing is clear: whatever the choices and actions of the contending parties, they will not lead to an immediate resolution. Popular discontent in the US has been building up for more than four decades. Many years of real prosperity would be needed to persuade the public that the country is back on the right track. So, for now, we can expect a lasting age of discord. Let’s hope that it won’t spill over into a hot civil war. • Peter Turchin is project leader at the Complexity Science Hub, Vienna, and the author of End Times: Elites, Counter-Elites and the Path of Political Disintegration (Allen Lane)."

        "Texte": "Enrichment activities are often seen as the poorer cousin to core academic subjects – but we know that they can have a powerful influence on a young person’s life and opportunities (Ireland’s big school secret: how a year off‑curriculum changes teenage lives, 16 October). Enrichment and non-formal learning activities support a young person’s social and personal development and skills for life, and work in ways that textbooks and traditional lessons can’t. These are the skills that employers tell us they really value and, when available, these are the activities that often engage young people the most. Ireland’s transition year shows us that there is scope to think outside the box on enrichment – and significant benefits to doing so. At The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, we see the impact that access to quality enrichment has on young people, helping to build confidence and independence, support wellbeing and inspire future career pathways. As the government embarks on its independent curriculum review and develops the new Ofsted school report card, it is essential that it uses this as an opportunity to consider how enrichment can play a more central part in education and ensure equity of access for all.

        "Titre": "Learning to swim as an adult is terrifying, embarrassing and wonderful | Alexandra Hansen",
        "Auteur": "Alexandra Hansen",
        "Date": "2025-01-04",
        "Texte": "I don’t know if I’ve always been afraid of water, but I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t. I remember as a child sitting next to the bath to watch it fill lest it flood the house if we stepped away while the tap was still running. I’d had no bad experiences (that I could remember); my fear seemed innate. Like most Australians, I had swimming lessons in primary school. One of the first tasks was to submerge your face and head in the water, and I flat-out refused. The instructor told me that if I didn’t I would have to stay in the first lane with the little kids doing water play. I said that was fine, and she left me alone after that. So I never learned to swim. I got by pretty well masking my inability – I became someone who was “not really a beach person”. And when I did go to the beach or pool I could wade and splash about in the shallows – no one noticed I rarely put my head under the water. I noticed, however, that when I walked past the pool on my way to the gym the smell of chlorine filled me with a choking anxiety. I would feel short of breath until the heady chemical smell was out of my nostrils. When I became a parent I had the same intrusive thoughts all parents have: what if my baby stops breathing in his sleep? What if he chokes on his food? What if we’re walking next to a river and we both slip in and I can’t save us? I’d learned first aid for babies, I’d studied the safe sleeping guidelines; I figured I should really learn to swim. The prospect of going to my local pool, in my mid-30s, and asking about beginner swimming lessons (“No, I don’t need to work on my stroke, I need to work on getting my face in the water”) was a somewhat embarrassing one. The prospect of finding some bathers to fit me in my postpartum period even more so. Standing on the side of the pool as I waited for my first lesson to begin, other women my age were gathered there to watch their kids’ lessons. A thought surfaced that I was a bit pathetic and I worried I might cry. I shared these feelings with a friend who said learning a new skill like swimming was no different from an adult taking guitar lessons. But it felt more like not knowing how to read – something it’s assumed everyone can already do and which must surely be harder to grasp as an adult. It’s generally assumed all Australian adults can swim but almost a quarter of us report weak or no swimming ability. So I am hardly alone, even though I’ve never heard another adult say they can’t swim. There were only two pupils in my first lesson – me and a middle-aged English man who had the simple, almost heartbreaking desire of wanting to swim in the sea for the first time. However difficult it had been for me to show up to that lesson, I wagered it had been more so for him. We started small. No putting our faces in the water, just some kicking as we lay on our backs, getting comfortable with having our ears under water. At first, I kicked my legs but went nowhere. It told the instructor I didn’t seem to be moving. She laughed and told me I soon would be. And, without knowing what had changed, I began to move. I managed to do loud but peaceful laps, up and down, up and down, hugging my kickboard, more than once bumping my head on the wall, not realising that’s what the flags ahead were for. I left the first lesson elated. I had done it. I swam. I didn’t drown and nobody laughed at me. Sure, I had used a flotation device, but I had walked out of there a little bit better than when I’d walked in. When it came time to put our faces in the water, the instructor told us about blowing bubbles. This was a concept I had never heard of. On the rare occasions I’d submerged myself in water I’d held my breath. After that lesson, I asked people if they knew you were meant to blow bubbles underwater. They said: “Of course! What else would you do under there?” My progress has been slow, but better than I had expected. I spend entire lessons swimming up and down the heated indoor kiddy pool, practising blowing bubbles, sometimes even dipping my eyes underneath the water. After each class, I have gained a new skill, or improved in some small way. It has quickly become addictive. The feeling of doing something I’ve never done, of overcoming a fear I never expected to overcome. I started going to the pool alone, swimming lap after lap practising whatever I had learned in that week’s lesson, trying to master the tiny incremental skill of taking one hand at a time off the kickboard, or breathing to the left, then to the right. I’ve spent hours holding a pool noodle, bobbing past groups of socialising teenagers in the recreational lane, and practising putting my face in the water. As I entered the pool one day I suddenly realised the smell of chlorine sparked my excitement not my terror. I’d started learning to swim for the sake of my child but I was staying for my own sake and for the euphoria I felt at being in the water, at beating my fear of swimming. I stopped noticing the discomfort of having water on my face, up my nose and in my ears, and instead started noticing the patterns of light dancing on the tiles of the pool. I came to enjoy that rushing pressure and the silence that hit my ears as they’re submerged. I’ve noticed my son is also afraid in water. He tenses up when placed in the bath, and clings to me in the shower and pool. I look up whether phobias can be inherited (they can be). If I have passed on my fear of water to my child I hope I can also pass on what I know about overcoming it. I’m not there yet, but I’m getting closer."

        "Titre": "Vlahovic sparks Juventus to leave Manchester City deep in trouble",
        "Auteur": "Jamie Jackson at the Allianz Stadium",
        "Date": "2024-12-11",
        "Texte": "Missing in action during the past six torrid weeks: Manchester City’s pizzazz. It was absent here again, in the latest moping performance that has become the recognisable face of Pep Guardiola’s formerly supreme team. There is now a surreal element about City’s plunge. Sides go on losing runs – sure they do – but for this champion group to lose for a seventh time in 10 games and extend their disturbing run to a meagre solitary victory in the sequence is baffling. It is befuddling Guardiola, who acknowledged his men should have won more times than they have since first going down at Tottenham in the Carabao Cup on 30 October. The manager’s statement came before this latest reverse, perhaps aired as a gee-up. It failed to work. Instead Juventus sealed a precious win thanks to Dusan Vlahovic’s 53rd-minute header and a second goal that came on the break when Timothy Weah flipped the ball in from the right and Weston McKennie thundered a volley home. Each were substitutes thrown on by Thiago Motta. His opposite number, 75 minutes in, had deployed none: one more sign of the torpor engulfing Guardiola and his charges. So City sit in 22nd, a point above Paris Saint-Germain, whose 25th position does not qualify for the playoffs. Next stop for City in Europe is a trip to Paris next month. At kick-off, City and Juve each had eight points so this was a clash of continental giants who needed victory and the boost it would provide on their return to domestic duties. Guardiola has exuded isolation, a loneliness that comes from serial losses and for the first time in nine years piloting City he cited injuries as mitigation, though he named a strong XI. It featured Ilkay Gündogan as the holding midfielder and Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish as twin playmakers. It had, too, Rico Lewis at left-back and his defensive fragility was exposed more than once, as when Francisco Conceição outmuscled him and Juve earned a corner.Too many mistakes is one Guardiola diagnosis of City’s ills. The Catalan demanded his charges play “simple”, then saw Lewis and Josko Gvardiol thump passes that missed Grealish near the Italian area. Gündogan and Kyle Walker did the same: each found Nicolo Savona rather than Jérémy Doku on the left. The second instance caused Guardiola to shake his head. When De Bruyne did locate his man, Erling Haaland’s clumsy touch had the ball ricocheting off his toes. City prosper when they pounce, tiger-like, and they remembered this for a fleeting moment. Doku scampered infield, De Bruyne read his run, possession was delivered and a rapid cross caused Juve to fling bodies at the ball to clear. Walker – oddly – seems to have been written off everywhere as suddenly geriatric and so slow he runs in reverse. If the right-back is an easy patsy for City’s ills – he is 34, and may have lost a fraction – the error that had Vlahovic bearing down on Ederson’s goal will have had those penning the career obituaries feeling vindicated. The wider story for City was the same one that has become no surprise. They lacked effervescence and confidence: a quaint state for the Premier League champions of the past four seasons and which will seem even stranger when looking back via the distance of time. Jump-leads are required to shock City back to what they have been and what Guardiola is sure they can be again. De Bruyne created a moment that might have done the trick but Haaland fluffed his lines. A swivel-and-dragback was followed by a cute pass that wrongfooted Juve and put Haaland in. But he could not finish and Guardiola rocked on his heels in frustration, not for the first time. His next act was the hands-above-the-head clap used for over-encouragement. It was apt following Walker blasting a short pass to De Bruyne straight out. Up went Guardiola’s arms and the flat pattern of City’s play continued. Motta’s men were stuck in their own rut, unable to knit any sequence together, so City kindly aided them with their latest defensive farce. After Federico Gatti’s scissor-kick was repelled by Ederson, Gvardiol’s clearance missed Walker, ceding the ball to Manuel Locatelli. He crossed, Vlahovic headed, and although it was straight at the keeper, the ball bounced off his chest and squeezed into the bottom left corner despite a despairing dive. Juve were up to 14th. Grealish’s dancing feet slipped in Bernardo Silva but his shot was blocked. Rúben Dias had spoken of the team’s travails being a chance to show character, but Ederson, once more, spilled a cross and City were teetering. Where was the carousel passing? The swagger and surety in front of goal? As in Guardiola’s first season, conviction was lacking. City went trophyless then. They may do again this season."

She is right to suggest that young people react badly to being considered empty vessels into which information is poured. Good teachers in our education system have avoided this model of learning for some time. However, the idea that children who find it difficult to work cooperatively would be better learning remotely fills me with dismay. My experience as a headteacher for more than 30 years is that where children are encouraged to be curious, to question and to collaborate, their learning becomes more relevant to them and more enjoyable. Working in isolation would not provide these opportunities. Perhaps we should look elsewhere for the reasons why many pupils are not motivated to attend school. In recent years, it has become more difficult for teachers to plan creatively to match the interests of their learners. The nonsensical prescriptive and irrelevant requirements introduced to the curriculum by Michael Gove, coupled with the terror of Ofsted, have helped to suck the joy from many classrooms. It takes a teacher with a track record of success and a supportive headteacher to step out of line and design activities that will make their classrooms exciting.

        "Titre": "Machine learning pioneers win Nobel prize in physics",
        "Auteur": "Ian Sample Science editor",
        "Date": "2024-10-08",
        "Texte": "Two researchers who helped lay the foundations for modern artificial intelligence – although one later warned of its potential harms – have been awarded the 2024 Nobel prize in physics. Inspired by the workings of the brain, John Hopfield, a US professor emeritus at Princeton University, and Geoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, built artificial neural networks that store and retrieve memories like the human brain, and learn from information fed into them. Hinton, 76, who is often called “the godfather of AI”, made headlines last year when he quit Google and warned about the dangers of machines outsmarting humans. The scientists’ pioneering work began in the 1980s and demonstrated how computer programs that draw on neural networks and statistics could form the basis for an entire field, which paved the way for swift and accurate language translation, facial recognition systems, and the generative AI that underpins chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. Hopfield, 91, was honoured for building “an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data”, while Hinton invented a method that can “independently discover properties in data”, an important feature of the large artificial neural networks in use today. In 1982, Hopfield built a neural network that stored images and other information as patterns, mimicking the way memories are stored in the brain. The network was able to recall images when prompted with similar patterns, akin to identifying a song heard only briefly in a noisy bar. Hinton built on Hopfield’s research by incorporating probabilities into a multilayered version of the neural network, leading to a program that could recognise, classify and even generate images after being fed a training set of pictures. Announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, the winners share the 11m Swedish kronor (about £810,000) prize for “foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks”. Ellen Moons, the chair of the Nobel committee for physics, said: “These artificial neural networks have been used to advance research across physics topics as diverse as particle physics, material science and astrophysics. They have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation.” Speaking at a press briefing immediately after the announcement, Hinton said he had received the call from Stockholm while staying in a cheap hotel in California that lacked an internet connection. “I’m flabbergasted,” he said. “I had no idea this would happen, I’m very surprised.” Hinton quit Google in order to speak freely about his concerns over the possible harms AI could inflict, from spreading misinformation and upending the jobs market to threatening human existence. Asked how AI might affect the world, Hinton told reporters: “I think it will have a huge influence. It will be comparable with the Industrial Revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it’s going to exceed people in the intellectual ability.” Having technology that was smarter than humans would be “wonderful in many respects”, Hinton said, leading to substantial improvements in healthcare, better digital assistants, and huge improvements in productivity. “But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control,” he added. “I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control.” Prof Michael Wooldridge, a computer scientist at the University of Oxford, said the award reflected the profound impact that AI was having. “The award is an indicator of just how much AI is transforming science,” he said. “The success of neural nets this century has made it possible to analyse data in ways that were unimaginable at the turn of the century. No part of the scientific world is left unchanged by AI: we find ourselves in a remarkable moment in scientific history, and it is wonderful to see the academy recognise this.” But Prof Dame Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton and an adviser to the UN on AI, said she was surprised at the award. “There is no Nobel prize for computer science so this is an interesting way of creating one, but it does seem a bit of a stretch,” she said. “Clearly artificial neural networks are having a profound effect on physics research, but is it fair to say that in themselves they are the result of physics research?”"

        "Auteur": "Sarah Johnson",
        "Date": "2024-12-29",
        "Texte": "Snoop Dogg has worked with artists including Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry and Mariah Carey – and now a small London charity for people with learning disabilities has joined that list. The rapper, with Dr Dre, sampled the song Watermelon Fantasy, released by the charity Daylight Studio in 2018, for the single Outta Da Blue from their new album, Missionary, which was released on 13 December. Watermelon Fantasy is performed by three artists with learning disabilities, and produced by the founder of Daylight Studio and one of its trustees. Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre have, between them, sold millions of records and have 42 Grammy award nominations. Tina Bruins, who features on the track and lives in supported housing in north London, said: “I was shocked. I remember being like: ‘Whaaaaaat?’ I didn’t know it was going to be released by Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg. I thought no, I thought it was a fantasy.” Bruins, 40, a longtime fan of Snoop Dogg, remembers watching his music videos on TV late at night. “It was a good shock because it sort of proves I make good music,” she said. “I’m proud of [Watermelon Fantasy] because Snoop Dogg took it over.” In the month since its release on 21 November, Outta Da Blue has been featured in the trailer for Back in Action, a Netflix film due to be released in January 2025 starring Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx; on the American football video game Madden NFL 25; and in an Amazon Music Live series where Snoop Dogg performed songs from throughout his career. Proceeds from the collaboration will be split equally between Bruins and two other artists with learning disabilities, Mandy Priddice and Cedrick Letshou Olembo, with production shares being donated back to the charity. Jack Daley, a recording engineer, and Oliver Price, a songwriter and music producer, made Watermelon Fantasy in 2017 with Bruins, Priddick and Letshou, while hosting music sessions at Daylight, a day centre for adults with learning disabilities, run by Islington council. When the centre closed temporarily during the coronavirus pandemic, Daley founded the charity, Daylight Studio, to continue his work composing and producing music with people with learning disabilities, with Price as a trustee. The Guardian first covered Daley’s work and Watermelon Fantasy in early 2019. Daley and Price believe if it weren’t for that coverage, the song would never have been discovered by Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. “This is the biggest thing that’s ever happened to me, and I’m pretty certain I can say that this year has been the best year of my life because of it,” said Daley. His and Price’s shares would be “life-changing” for the charity and will fund and expand its work over the next couple of years. Price said: “I still can’t believe it’s a real thing. It sort of feels divinely ordained because the song is called Outta Da Blue and it came out of the blue and it’s like we’re living in a watermelon fantasy. It’s all quite funny really.” He added: “I’m excited about the charity and bringing attention to people with learning difficulties. They are often put in a box separate from society, and no one ever sees them or works with them … But they have a lot to offer as we have just demonstrated.” All involved would like to do more collaborations with local and international artists making use of Daylight Studio’s catalogue of music. “We want to continue creating music and maybe this won’t be the last sample,” said Price. “It would be awesome if Kendrick Lamar or Drake or someone [would use it]. You just don’t know.” The Guardian approached representatives for Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre but neither were available to comment."

        "Titre": "How I Learned to Swim review – a dive into the deep waters of Black aquatic history",
        "Auteur": "Chris Wiegand",
        "Date": "2024-08-13",
        "Texte": "The depths plumbed by Somebody Jones’s new play are extraordinary as one woman’s swimming lessons open up an expansive world of aquatic Black history and myth. Jones glides deftly enough between the youth and adulthood of reluctant 30-year-old newbie swimmer Jamie, who is haunted by her brother’s disappearance. But she also manages to place Jamie’s encounters with her instructor and a spiritual guide against a backdrop including the “Middle Passage” of the transatlantic slave trade, the watery Afrofuturist world of Drexciya and the legacy of segregated swimming pools in the US. Jones, an Angeleno now living in London, adds British history, too, by referencing Paul Marshall, one of the first Black swimmers to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. Her monologue provides ample reasoning for why, according to recent Sport England statistics, 95% of Black adults do not swim. Presented by Prentice Productions in association with Brixton House, the play is staged by Emma Jude Harris with an assurance that matches the script. Debbie Duru’s set has a platform tiled in white and blue, with the handles of a pool ladder, surrounded by rubber flooring. It is coolly lit by Ali Hunter, while composer Nicola T Chang’s sound design includes echoey waterdrops. Added to Jones’s sensory detail, it means you can almost sniff the chlorine, which Jamie likens to the smell of anxiety. Frankie Hart is excellent in the role, holding apprehension in her body and then physically evoking her first plunges. Jamie starts by remembering her first pool party as a nervous nine-year-old and Hart manages to retain an element of youth in her delivery, including a degree of giddy-stroppy behaviour about her lessons as an adult. This delicate balancing act helps a serpentine production just about land its magical-realist conclusion, by which time Jones has steeped water in personal and historical trauma. Swimming brings Jamie an increased sense of independence but Jones emphasises the essentially communal properties of water itself, which will support Jamie if she has faith when easing herself into it. Not every supporting character emerges clearly from this odyssey but its aquatic world becomes a compelling, ultimately unfathomable protagonist. At Roundabout @ Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 26 August. Then at Brixton House, London, 4-14 September and Bristol Old Vic, 17-21 September."

        "Titre": "Norway forced to pause plans to mine deep sea in Arctic",
        "Auteur": "Karen McVeigh",
        "Date": "2024-12-02",
        "Texte": "The Norwegian government has paused its plans to mine the deep sea in the Arctic, after pressure from a small leftwing party. The agreement was reached after the Socialist Left (SV) party said it would not support the government’s budget unless it halted the first round of licences for deep-sea mining exploration, planned for the first half of 2025. “This puts a stop to the plans to start deep-sea mining until the end of the government’s term,” said Kirsti Bergstø, the leader of the SV party. In January, Norway became the first country in the world to give the go-ahead to commercial deep-sea mining, after parliamentary approval. The coalition government said that while the licences had been suspended preparatory work would still continue, including carrying out an environmental impact assessment and setting regulations. “This will be a postponement,” the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, from the Labour party, told the private broadcaster TV2 on Sunday. Environmental groups described the news as a “historic win” for ocean protection. Oslo had planned to let companies apply to mine 280,000 sq km (108,000 sq miles) of its waters, an area greater than the UK, for deep-sea minerals. “After hard work from activists, environmentalists, scientists and fishermen, we have secured a historic win for ocean protection, as the opening process for deep-sea mining in Norway has been stopped,” said Haldis Tjeldflaat Helle, a deep-sea mining campaigner at Greenpeace Nordic. Norway is being sued by one of the world’s largest environmental groups, WWF, over its move to open up the seabed for mining. WWF claims it has failed to properly investigate the consequences. The Norwegian Environment Agency, which advises the government, has also said the impact assessment does not provide a sufficient scientific or legal basis for deep-sea mining. The plans have also met international opposition. In February, the European parliament expressed its concern over Norway’s decision, and called on member states to support a moratorium. The government has said an official study showed that substantial accumulations of metals and minerals, ranging from copper to rare earth elements, had been found on its continental shelf. It argues such metals are needed for the green transition to fossil fuels. A coalition of 32 countries, including the UK, Germany, France, Canada and Brazil, has called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining in international waters."

        "Titre": "Deep Purple review – age cannot wither these pogoing rock elders",
        "Auteur": "Michael Hann",
        "Date": "2024-11-07",
        "Texte": "There are certain things that have to be factored into life: Boris Johnson will self-promote; Five Guys is overpriced; and Deep Purple (and their spinoff bands) will plague the audience with solo spots. Thankfully, those solos are no longer quite as interminable as they were in the days when the band would only fit nine songs into their set because everyone had to have a moment in the spotlight. Tonight, Don Airey’s two keyboard solos and Simon McBride’s guitar spot only occupy 15 minutes of an otherwise tight set of just shy of two hours. The rest of the time, Deep Purple are not just surprisingly good, but actually good. At 79, Ian Gillan isn’t going to be asking for Child in Time to be returned to the set to test his falsetto scream, but his voice is strong and true, and he can summon a roar when needed, as on Into the Fire. Ian Paice, 76, thunders around his drum kit like a man a quarter of his age, while bassist Roger Glover is one of the few 78-year-olds who can still pogo on stage. The classics remain classic: the brutal, one-chord opening of Highway Star would do Osees proud for its fearsome drone; Lazy is a potent reminder that Purple sprang from the 60s R&amp;B scene, Hammond organ and harmonica combining into something that has far more in common with the Graham Bond Organisation than the metal bands Purple inspired. What is most refreshing, though, is that a third of the set is drawn from this year’s album =1, and those songs absolutely stand up to the ones most of the crowd have come to hear. Lazy Sod has a typically eccentric lyric from Gillan, but its groove and power would have done the group proud in 1972, while Now You’re Talkin’ has the same propulsive thrill as Highway Star: the use of Hammond organ to supply the parts usually played by rhythm guitar giving it that distinctive Purple rumble. The set finishes with Black Night, and Purple depart, having proved that sometimes the old folks know best. • Deep Purple play Leeds First Direct Arena, 7 November; AO Arena, Manchester, 9 November; and OVO Hydro, Glasgow, 10 November"

        "Titre": "Hubris by Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe review – learning from the Neanderthals",
        "Auteur": "Laura Spinney",
        "Date": "2024-12-27",
        "Texte": "In an institute in Germany, scientists are growing “Neanderthalised” human brain cells in a dish. These cells form synapses and spark as they would have done in a living Neanderthal as she (they are female cells) foraged or breastfed or gazed out of a cave mouth at dusk. That is the spine-tingling opening gambit of a book co-authored by one of the directors of the institute, Johannes Krause, and the information that sets it apart from a host of popular science books that attempt to predict humanity’s future based on our evolutionary past. A mere 90 genetic differences distinguish modern humans, Homo sapiens, from Neanderthals, Homo neanderthalensis. That’s paltry, given the roughly 20,000 genes that make up the human blueprint, and not all of them affect the brain. Yet those 90 differences could explain why Neanderthals died out, some 40,000 years ago, while we went on to dominate the planet. They could hold the key to how we, the apparently more adaptable human type, might adapt again before we destroy the ecosystems we depend on, and ourselves along with them. That, at least, is the rationale behind the German experiment. In order to really understand the effects of the differences, the scientists would need to build whole organs, ideally whole Neanderthals, and then compare them to modern humans on a suite of measures. Since they agree with most of the rest of us that this would be morally objectionable, they make do with rudimentary brains, so-called brain organoids (the Guardian’s science correspondent describes them as “lentil-sized” and “incapable of thoughts or feelings”). Building these already poses a technical challenge, and it will be a few years before they have completed the task. Most of the rest of the book is given over to an update on the history of human evolution, which is something of a moving target at the moment, thanks to the 20-year-old technology that made it possible to extract and read DNA from ancient bones. The story gets more complicated with almost every telling, but one message comes through loud and clear: most branches of the human family were evolutionary dead ends. The only one that survived to the present day, us, very nearly didn’t. Something gave sapiens an edge, but what was it? Culture? The ability to build large social networks? A utopian dream and a kamikaze approach to realising it? Or chance? Whatever it was made us aggressively expansionist, and nowhere were our expansionist tendencies more impressive than in Austronesia. Starting in Taiwan about 5,000 years ago, our ancestors cast off from a succession of overcrowded islands with animals, seeds and children on board, but no guarantee that they would glimpse the next piece of land within thousands of miles of ocean. The time came when modern humans had occupied every last atoll, then every last scrap of the habitable planet. Now we’re looking hungrily to the moon and Mars. The biological urge to perpetuate one’s genes is not distinctively human; we share it with every other organism. Curiosity isn’t an exclusively human trait either; apes strayed out of Africa long before us. Nor were we always rapacious. The authors repeat a long-held claim that Easter Island, Rapa Nui to its original inhabitants, was stripped bare by those inhabitants’ descendants, who thereby ensured their own demise. But new research has questioned that interpretation, finding that people lived sustainably there prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 19th century. We did survive all the other hominins, though, and that needs explaining. Krause and Trappe’s argument accommodates the Rapa Nui rethink, because they claim that it was only in the 20th century that Homo sapiens became Homo hubris – when the exponential growth in human population, technological innovation, mean global temperatures and biodiversity loss transformed us into an existential threat to ourselves. That transformation happened so fast that it must have been the product of cultural rather than biological evolution, but the capacity to adapt through culture ultimately lies in the genes. The authors say there is no evidence that Neanderthals made art, which if true might imply that they were less capable of abstract thinking than us. Not everybody would agree with that, but most would concede that Neanderthals differed from us linguistically and cognitively. The question is: can we leverage those differences to rein in our avaricious impulses before it’s too late? Can we mobilise culture to override biology? In case anyone needs reminding, that means coordinating the behaviour of 8 billion already-born for the good of the still-to-be-born. We’ve failed dismally so far, but maybe we still have it in us. Or maybe the real hubris is to think that we are anything other than a dead end waiting to happen. The Neanderthals roamed the planet for nearly 400,000 years; we have been here for 300,000. When all is said and done, who will be judged the winner (and who will judge)? • Hubris: The Rise, Fall and Future of Humanity by Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe, translated by Sharon Howe, is published by Polity (£25).

        "Titre": "Country diary: A needle of solstice sunlight reaches into my deep past | Mary Montague",
        "Auteur": "Mary Montague",
        "Date": "2024-12-21",
        "Texte": "The darkness was tomb-black. Through all of our breathing, the spell thickened as a needle of light stole across the chamber’s floor. The mind is a strange thing, hovering between past and future, aware of its own ability to draw meaning from an occurrence. As the glow lit our shadowy faces, we smiled and murmured with pleasure, but it was stronger emotion that brimmed my eyes. We were inside Newgrange, a neolithic monument built about 5,000 years ago by people who studied the sun’s movement with sufficient attention to pinpoint the moment when the season changed. To catch that brief occurrence, they built a cantilevered stone chamber and covered it with a mound of earth. Above the entrance to the passage from the outside world, they fixed a narrow aperture aligned to the winter solstice. On that day, a clear dawn floods the interior with golden light. Modern astronomy tells us precisely how this happens. During the year, the sun’s path across our sky is altered by the elliptical shape of the Earth’s orbit. In the northern hemisphere, as winter deepens, the sun seems to drift south. Its arc narrows and slumps, which nudges dawn (from left to right) along the horizon. Heat goes out of the days. Shadows lengthen. Night dominates. With the season’s progress, the daily shift in the sun’s movement decreases. And then it stops. This is the moment of solstice, when time itself seems to stand still. After that, dawn reverses direction along the skyline as the solar arc climbs back to summer’s zenith. Writing ahead of 21 December, it’s time for me to admit that the narrow beam I saw illuminating the chamber came, not from a midwinter sunrise but, rather, from an artificial light simulating it. I was part of one of the regular tours for those people not lucky enough to win a golden ticket to enter Newgrange during the actual solstice. Arguably, my experience wasn’t real. But the dark chamber was real. As was the reverence of our small group. As was my body’s reaction. Because the mind is a strange thing, flitting from here to there, between then and now, all the while anchored by the deep past. Because it’s still the same moment when, at last, darkness shrinks from the light. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount"

        "Titre": "Deep intelligence penetration enabled Israel to kill Hassan Nasrallah",
        "Auteur": "Dan Sabbagh Defence and security editor",
        "Date": "2024-09-30",
        "Texte": "A hundred munitions – including, it is believed, US-made 2,000lb bombs – were used by the Israeli air force in Friday evening’s overwhelming air raid that killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an underground complex hidden in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh. Nasrallah, who was careful to the point of paranoia about his security arrangements and only rarely appeared in public, would have given little notice of his plan to undertake the fateful trip to the meeting. But the intelligence penetration of Hezbollah was so deep that Israel knew Nasrallah and other surviving members of Hezbollah’s already decimated leadership would be meeting at the supposedly secret location – and that an order to bomb them could be given. Benjamin Netanyahu was required to give permission to undertake the attack from New York, where the Israeli prime minister had given a bellicose speech at the UN general assembly. There was, presumably, felt to be little time to wait. According to an unsubstantiated report in the French newspaper Le Parisien, the mole who informed the Israelis that Nasrallah was on his way to the bunker was Iranian. If true, it would be eye-catching, given that Iran is Hezbollah’s principal backer. The reports of the planning behind the attack indicate that Israel had an eye on the location for some time. The commander of the 69th Squadron of F-15I jets that carried out the attack, named in Israeli media only as Lt Col M, said the aircrews involved were preparing for “several days”, though they were told of the intended target only a few hours before. The F-15I jets were armed to strike and destroy below ground, requiring a large amount of explosive, capable also of eliminating the buildings above. Video released by the Israel Defense Forces on Saturday of the jets “taking off for the strike from Hatzerim airbase” showed eight US-made F-15Is. One taking off is laden with multiple missiles, under the wings and at the rear. Experts said they appeared to be American-manufactured BLU-109 2,000lb bombs, of the class the Biden administration had decided to withhold from Israel in the summer amid concerns about their use in densely populated Gaza. Justin Bronk, an aviation expert with the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) thinktank, said the Israeli air force would have probably used 2,000lb joint direct attack munition (JDAM) guided missiles fitted with penetrating fuses designed to explode after a building or the ground is struck. Israeli air force officers said that during the attack, named Operation New Order, about 100 munitions were used and that bombs were dropped “every two seconds”. Four residential buildings were hit, three destroyed utterly, leaving behind only smouldering craters, and two more were damaged in the strike. Initial estimates on the ground suggested that 300 people may have been killed, although Lebanon’s official count was that 11 were killed and 108 wounded. Israel said it had killed more than 20 members of Hezbollah and that the strike was justified because “Nasrallah intentionally built Hezbollah’s central headquarters under residential buildings in Dahiya”. Brig Gen Amichai Levine, the commander of the Hatzerim airbase where the 69th Squadron is based, gave more details of the planning. The first challenge, in what he coldly described as “elimination operations” was precise intelligence; the second, he said at a briefing, was to ensure that the target “does not escape while the planes are en route or the munitions are on their way to the target” – for example by not receiving early warning that the fighter jets were in the air and on their way. A tantalising question is why Nasrallah felt it necessary to meet other Hezbollah members in person. It was nearly a fortnight ago that Israel’s war against Hezbollah stepped up with the explosions of sabotaged pagers and walkie-talkies used by the militant group that may have injured as many as 1,500 – low tech preferred by Nasrallah because he distrusted the way mobile phones could be tracked. With all electronic means distrusted, a face-to-face meeting may have been the only way to discuss Israel’s escalation of the crisis with close colleagues. In any event, it is now clear that Israel has been unfolding an orchestrated plan in the past fortnight to attack and destroy Hezbollah’s military leadership, from the pager attack to several rounds of airstrikes, wreaking havoc on Lebanese civilians as it does so. An estimated million people have been displaced as well as several hundred killed, a price Israel deems acceptable as it seeks to halt Hezbollah attacks on Israel’s north and allow 65,000 Israelis to go back home from the border area. Israel’s success in killing Nasrallah and other leaders can only have come following an intelligence penetration of Hezbollah that stands in sharp contrast to the misjudgment of Hamas’s intentions before 7 October. Matthew Savill, a military analyst at Rusi, said Israel probably “spent years building up and sustaining a comprehensive intelligence picture” of Hezbollah, involving “an element of human sources involved, to keep it current”. That, he argued, “brings into even starker relief the failure to identify and prevent Hamas’s operation last year, lending credibility to the theory they concentrated on Lebanon and Iran at the expense of Gaza”. • This article was amended on 30 September 2024. Through a metonymic reference, an earlier version may have suggested Jerusalem was the capital of Israel. While it is the seat of government, and was designated as the country’s capital by the Knesset in 1980, it is not recognised as the capital by most of the international community."

        "Titre": "How Trump won over voters in deep-blue New York City",
        "Auteur": "Adam Gabbatt",
        "Date": "2024-11-09",
        "Texte": "Donald Trump’s presidential win was ultimately determined by voters in swing states, but a shift towards the Republican was seen across the country – even in the deeply Democratic stronghold of New York City. While Kamala Harris won New York by a handy margin, with 68% of the vote to Trump’s 30%, that was a marked drop from Joe Biden’s performance in the city in 2020; that year, Biden won New York by a 53-point margin. “Almost no place has seen a bigger increase in Trump support than the five boroughs [of New York City],” Nate Silver, the renowned political pollster, wrote on Thursday. One of those boroughs, Staten Island, has been in bed with Trump since the beginning – the president-elect carried the majority-white area in 2016 and 2020 – but the shifts elsewhere are more surprising. The Bronx, which has a large Latino population, saw the largest swing towards Trump in the state: Joe Biden won 83% of the vote there in 2020, compared with Trump’s 16%. This time round, Harris won by 73% to Trump’s 27%. In 2016, Trump won just 21.8% of the vote in Queens, his home borough, but this week 38% of voters there cast their ballot for the former and now future president. In fact, every single county in the New York City metropolitan area swung towards Trump compared with four years ago, Gothamist reported. It’s a staggering shift for a multicultural, heavily Democratic city, given the divisive and racist nature of Trump’s campaign. But it shouldn’t have come as a huge surprise to Democrats, said Lawrence Levy, former chief political columnist for Newsday and executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. “Something started happening in 2021,” Levy said. “This did not come out of the blue.” That year, New York City politics started seeing some reactions to “post-pandemic pain”, Levy said, as some voters from demographics including the white, Latino and Asian communities shifted away from Democrats in local elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, New York City retained its Democratic members of the House of Representatives, but some suburban voters to the north and east of the city elected Republicans. “The question is: what does this all mean?” Levy said. “I think we’re at an inflection point where once the echo of pandemic pain finally fades, we’ll either go back to where we were – which is that New York City is reliably blue and that the surrounding suburbs will go back to being purple to light-blue places. “Or it’s the bigger pendulum that: ‘OK, Democrats had their run for 30 years, and now the pendulum is going to swing back the other way.” While New York City has reliably voted for Democratic presidents, two out of its last four mayors were elected as Republicans – although they weren’t the blood-and-thunder candidates who have come to dominate the modern GOP. Mona Kleinberg, a professor of political science at the City University of New York, Queens College, said it was unclear yet whether the swing towards Trump was a result of people who voted for Biden casting their ballot for Trump, or those voters not voting at all – just as nationwide, Harris received fewer votes than Biden. In terms of why Harris underperformed compared with Biden, Kleinberg said New Yorkers were not immune to two of the key issues that motivated people around the country: the economy and inflation. “In New York, the economy was huge, because New York is an unaffordable city. Rents have gone up so much after Covid, and then you have a candidate who promises to, essentially, bring inflation down even more, who promises to bring rents down,” she said. “New Yorkers are not universally affluent, and so they care about those issues. So I think with inflation, or the economy more broadly, Donald Trump had a better message on that.” Despite New York being one of the most diverse cities in the US, immigration also played a part, Kleinberg said. The city has received about 200,000 new immigrants in the past two years, as states including Texas have sought to create chaos by sending tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants on buses to New York. Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York – whose popularityplummeted after he was charged with taking bribes and foreign campaign contributions and appears to have been trying to cozy up to Trump in recent days – handled the immigrant situation badly, Kleinberg said, which could have further turned voters away from the party. A scheme where immigrant families were given prepaid debit cards became a particular focus for conservative critics, and may have played into ideas that Democrats are out of touch. “If you feel like every time you’re going grocery shopping, you’re broke afterwards, and then you know that there are asylum seekers in your city who are getting debit cards with a certain kind of allowance to live, that breeds resentment. And if you don’t have a message that explains this to people, then they are just angry,” Kleinberg said. “So I think you know this was a referendum not just on Biden’s legacy, or the Biden-Harris administration, but this was also a referendum on the Democratic leadership in New York City.” National and local issues both played a part in the swing, then – although something more fundamental may also have played a part. “Obviously, Trump was running on an anti-immigrant message and, of course, Kamala Harris was the actual embodiment of an immigrant – she’s the daughter of a south Asian mother and a Jamaican father,” Kleinberg said. “And again: the fact that she is a woman, and a woman of color. There’s a lot of unconscious biases that introduce in people’s perceptions of her capabilities. And I think that is part of this whole cocktail of reasons for why people migrated towards the right.” • This article was amended on 11 November 2024 to correct an earlier version that inaccurately stated Kamala Harris’s mother is south-east Asian. She is south Asian."

        "Titre": "Democrats should stop mocking Trump’s ground game and start learning from it",
        "Auteur": "Astra Taylor",
        "Date": "2024-11-25",
        "Texte": "Since campaign season began, experts have assured us that Donald Trump had “no ground game”, a phrase that generally refers to a campaign’s effort to mobilize voters through local outreach offices, phone calls, text messages, and door knocks. Pundits, politicos, and partisan observers repeated this charge and scoffed at his ramshackle, amateur, and fraud-riddled efforts, with some seasoned Republican operatives even sounding the alarm. A slew of articles and commentary unfavorably compared Trump’s “paltry” get-out-the-vote operation to the Democrats’ supposedly well-oiled and professionally managed machine. Alex Floyd, the Democratic national committee’s rapid response director, issued a confident statement in April: “Donald Trump’s Maga takeover of the [Republican national committee] has left the Republican party in shambles, lacking the ground game and infrastructure to compete this November.” We all know how that story ended. And yet many Democrats remain reluctant to reassess their views, both of Trump’s ground game and, perhaps more importantly, of their own. Soon after the election, Tom O’Brien, chair of the Democratic party in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, told the New York Times that Republicans “really didn’t have a ground game”. The Democratic strategist Christy Setzer went further, telling the Hill that “Trump had no ground game and ran only on rambling hatred”, while insisting that the loss “wasn’t the fault of Kamala Harris”, who had “the best campaign any of us has ever seen”. But if that’s true, why did Trump succeed where Harris failed? Trump succeeded, at least in part, because he is a man who will say anything and do anything to win. And of course he was boosted by conservative media – by Fox News talkshows, conspiratorial podcasts, manosphere influencers, deceptive deepfakes, targeted ads, and “First Buddy” Elon Musk’s transformation of Twitter into X. But he also won because he had a strong ground game, even if it occasionally blundered and often looked different from what observers and experts expected from a get-out-the vote drive, including its use of “untraditional” and “micro-targeted” strategies aimed at reaching low- and mid-propensity voters who didn’t fit the usual Republican profile, including Latinos, Black men, and Asian and Arab Americans. The rocky launch of Musk’s new political action committee, America Pac, which hired canvassers in key areas, became a punchline, but it was last-minute outreach that supplemented other efforts. (And America Pac is no joke: Musk has invested $120m in the project and is already planning for the 2026 midterms and beyond.) Belittling and discounting Trump’s operation might make liberals feel better, but strategically, it’s self-defeating. This hubris leaves Democrats oblivious to their opponents’ achievements, while they overestimate their own approach. And it makes it harder to appreciate what needs to change if Democrats want to not only win elections but govern effectively and in ways that materially improve people’s lives. Since Harris’s defeat, even moderate commentators are waking up to the fact that Democrats need to shift their messaging in order to increase their appeal to working class voters who have turned away from the party or toward Trump. But while embracing the rhetoric of economic populism would be a good start, tweaks to language are not enough. Our definition of “ground game” must evolve as well – “knocking on doors eight or nine times”, which is how O’Brien described his party’s efforts, will not be enough to remedy the Democrats’ current disadvantage or revitalize small-d democracy. Committing to a cause A few weeks before the election, in Greensboro, North Carolina, Nikki Marín Baena was outside her home when she was approached by a canvasser from Libre Initiative, a Koch-backed organization that targets Latino communities with a libertarian agenda. The canvasser told her about all the services the group offers: Spanish language workshops for parents on how to apply for scholarships, English language tutoring, computer classes and more. In Baena’s words, Libre’s goal is to get people in a room, help them meet their basic needs, and then preach the gospel of small government. Beana is a co-founder of Siembra NC, which mostly organizes around workers’ rights, in particular the challenges many immigrant laborers face, including wage theft. Ideologically, Baena is diametrically opposed to Libre’s politics, but she is fascinated by their tactics. She has seen Libre staffers doing stunts outside discount grocery stores, blasting Bidenomics and inflation. They offer cash-strapped shoppers gift cards in the amount of money that Democrats’ policies supposedly “stole” from them. People are grateful for the help and so they stop to chat. By capturing the Republican party, Trump positioned himself to reap the benefits of decades of work by rightwing activists, donors and strategists who aimed to strengthen the grip of conservative ideologues and corporate interests on American political life. With laser-like focus, they attacked labor unions, gutted campaign finance law, captured the courts, reconfigured electoral maps and mobilized key interest groups, from anti-abortion activists to gun lovers. And they are actively broadening their reach. When Democrats insist that Trump had no ground game, they ignore the right wing’s investment and presence in spaces that are not purely electoral and that engage people year-round, including groups like Libre, along with the evangelical churches and student groups that increasingly function as social clubs recruiting people to the Maga cause. As Tiffany Dena Loftin details in the new issue of the Black leftist magazine Hammer &amp; Hope, the right wing has spent decades systematically attacking and defunding progressive student unions and networks and building up their conservative counterparts. The Charlie Kirk-founded and Republican billionaire-funded Turning Point USA claims to have “freedom chapters” at more than 3,500 colleges and high schools, which offer young conservatives a sense of belonging and community, leadership development, and pathways to political engagement, of which get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts are just one part. The Trump campaign built on this model, providing its base with community and purpose and organizing them, in turn, to mobilize others to turn out and vote. Before joining Trump’s team as campaign co-chair, Susie Wiles spent years working to lock down Florida for Republicans (she’s since been named Trump’s incoming chief of staff). Her tactics make people feel like an essential part of a group with a clear goal. Wiles piloted the “10 for Trump” Iowa caucus program, which gave a subset of 2,000 volunteers the title of “captain”, a limited-edition gold-embroidered hat, and the goal of motivating 10 people in their precincts to turn out. In the general election, specially trained volunteers were dubbed “Trump Force 47” and tasked with developing longer term relationships with so-called low- or mid-propensity voters, going beyond the usual door-knocking to forge relationships aimed at converting these targets into Republican loyalists. The campaign also used Trump’s false claims of election fraud to recruit and train tens of thousands of hyper-vigilant poll workers and Maga acolytes. “Trump or someone around him is quite bright about the definitional difference between mobilization and organization,” Tory Gavito, founder of Way to Win, told me. Mobilizing people to turn out and cast a ballot is not nearly as powerful as organizing people to adopt an identity, commit to a cause, and join a collective effort to push for change. That’s why Way to Win, a progressive donor network, directs funds to groups that do year-round organizing, rather than helicoptering in days or weeks before an election or relying on high-profile celebrity endorsements. In Gavito’s estimation, Trump’s GOTV effort probably mattered less in the end than what she calls the “organizations and institutions that shape worldviews” and engage large numbers of people in their daily lives. That’s where the Democrats’ super polished, pop-up ground game fell short. ‘Knocked on too many doors’ Ironically, the right not only has its own (often lavishly funded) political and cultural infrastructure; it also benefits from infrastructure’s absence in a way the left does not. Widespread feelings of isolation, loneliness and alienation help their cause. The conservative culture warrior Christopher Rufo, for example, has boasted about how a lack of social trust works to his advantage. Distrust makes it easier to spread lies and misinformation and pit communities against each other – to divide and conquer in order to shrink government, raise corporate profits, and concentrate power. Firelands Workers United is an organization that brings together working families to rebuild this tattered social trust, working in rural Washington, including in counties where majorities voted for Trump. They do so by organizing for good jobs, housing, healthcare and fair taxes. The way they organized in 2024 offers a lesson in class-based solidarity that the national Democratic party should learn from. This electoral cycle, Firelands’ base was focused on fighting several ballot measures. Washington might be a blue state, but it is one with a remarkably regressive tax system and perennial budget problems. This year the California hedge fund manager Brian Heywood spent $6m on four ballot measures that aimed to repeal popular policies, including a recently passed capital gains tax. The result would have reduced funding for affordable childcare and schools and killed rural jobs. If the capital gains ballot measure had passed, 4,000 wealthy Washingtonians would get richer while everyone else, non-immigrant and immigrant, would pay the price. Through 2024, Firelands trained dozens of members so they could educate their communities about this looming threat. They did so by emphasizing a shared class interest, not partisan loyalties, which allowed them to reach across cultural and political divides. “This isn’t about Republicans or Democrats. People out here are frustrated with any politician who sides with the rich over working people,” said the group’s co-founder Stina Janssen. Firelands members collaborate across very different backgrounds. A Washington-born retired corrections officer and a Latin American immigrant mill worker would canvas together and develop a real relationship. They, in turn, would connect with voters over anger at billionaires and inequality and invite them into a movement, opening space for people’s assumptions and attitudes to change. “There would not have been a chance to build these friendships or for the people born here to learn and hear people’s immigration stories with the same level of curiosity without this close work together,” Janssen said. Now the group’s non-immigrant members understand what it means for someone to be facing deportation. And immigrant members feel less alone as they understand they are not the only people struggling with healthcare or rent. “Our organizing approach held and affirmed everyone’s suffering and helped people see how their experiences were tied together,” Janssen explained. This “dignity-based solidarity”, as Janssen calls it, isn’t about asking people to check their privilege. It’s rooted in the recognition that we all suffer and deserve better: making ends meet shouldn’t be this hard for me or for you. This kind of deep organizing takes time because it aims at shifting political consciousness and fostering enduring commitment. It also requires resources. As Baena told me, groups like Turning Point and Libre Initiative “can hire so many people because they have endless money”. It’s easier to fund an organization that helps billionaires’ bottom lines than one that threatens them. Yet Democrats had plenty of money this year, much of which was contributed by smaller donors. But they spent it on the standard playbook. The Harris campaign spent billions blanketing the airwaves with ads (outspending Republicans three to one on paid media), bombarding undecided voters with text messages, and bussing out-of-state volunteers to canvas neighborhoods. None of those tactics leave a trace after the campaign pulls up stakes. They might as well have set the cash on fire. Like many other organizers I spoke to, Billy Wimsatt, the executive director of Movement Voter Pac (MVP), believes those resources could have been deployed more wisely. “What if, instead of spending millions to keep cable news on life support, you had split that money between strategically building up local organizing and online influencer organizing?” he said. This year, MVP moved money to hundreds of organizations that do year-round issue-based organizing in key battleground states in addition to GOTV. That entailed everything from mutual aid to media to ballot measures and candidate recruitment. Wimsatt highlighted the work of Faith in Minnesota, a multi-faith, multi-racial, statewide organization. The group organizes diverse communities, including Muslims and manufactured home park residents, around high-impact issues like housing affordability. This season, Faith in Minnesota volunteers had thousands of conversations with voters and helped protect the state house from flipping to Republicans. “Real organizing wins. Superficial mobilizing loses,” Wimsatt said. Andrew Willis Garcés, another Siembra NC co-founder, puts it bluntly: Democrats across the country actually “knocked too many doors”. The party’s much ballyhooed ground game failed because it was engineered to facilitate one-off conversations that stick to a script instead of supporting local organizations and campaigns that engage ordinary people around issues they care about. For the people Siembra aims to reach, that means fights to recover stolen wages, stop local law enforcement from collaborating with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and win protections for mobile home tenants. Garcés believes that these kinds of local issue campaigns can drive voter engagement by helping people connect their lived experience to candidates or campaigns that might otherwise seem distant, abstract or uninspiring. That can make a difference in an election like the recent one, which Baena describes as a three-way race between Trump, Harris and the couch. In terms of sheer numbers, the couch came out ahead. While much has been said about Latino men turning to Trump, Baena and Garcés believe the real story is that lots of Latino voters, like other key voting groups, “sat this one out”. All told, nearly 90 million eligible voters, 36% of the overall electorate, stayed home. As Baena sees it, the Democrats didn’t have much to offer working people, whatever their race, gender or ethnicity, in terms of tangible improvement to their daily lives or a clear and compelling vision of why the future under Harris would have been better. At the door, there wasn’t much to say besides “the other guy is bad”. You can’t win people over by telling them everything is fine when they can’t afford groceries, rent, and gas, or when they are upset about the war on Gaza. This all goes back to the lack of trust. “People don’t trust people outside their families and they don’t trust politicians or the government,” Baena said. Parachuting canvassers into a community to have one-time conversations will never truly move the needle; you need to listen and earn trust before you can change minds. “The work of base-building is getting people to befriend strangers and build community outside of their families, and that’s a pathway to getting people to trust their neighbors and institutions,” he added. “If liberals really care about winning elections,” Baena continued, “they need to reach these people. We need year-round organizing to really bring people in and to show them that they and their families can benefit from public investment and services. And we have to organize in a way that allows the base to feel they’ve helped win the election, not that the campaign won.” That’s the feeling Firelands managed to inspire in its members – a feeling of being agents of change, not passive consumers of politics. On election day, all the regressive ballot measures were voted down in the rural areas where Firelands and their partners organized, including Grays Harbor county, where Trump won 51.5% of the vote but nearly 60% of voters said “no” to repealing taxes on capital gains. Groups like Faith in Minnesota and Firelands show that by emphasizing shared class interests and focusing on clear progressive policies, it’s possible to make inroads with voters who are skeptical of politicians and even sympathetic to aspects of the Maga movement. People-centered, issue-focused organizing Before the 2016 election, the New York senator Chuck Schumer made a now infamous pronouncement about the Democratic party’s electoral strategy: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” In 2021, on the other hand, the then US representative Jim Banks of Indiana (now senator-elect) shared a memo with the then House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, detailing how the Republican party could “permanently become the Party of the Working Class” in part by appealing to “minority voters”. Three years later, Banks’s proposal no longer reads as wishful thinking. Trump’s campaign made inroads with low-income communities and voters of color in urban and rural areas nationwide, including peeling off an alarming number of unionized voters. Meanwhile, Schumer’s plan of tacking to the center in order to target Republican voters at the expense of less affluent Democratic ones helped Harris get trounced. Instead of aspiring to razor-thin margins of victory, Democrats must become more populist and more ambitious. But better messaging must be coupled with a disciplined strategy to expand the voting base and win resounding majorities so politicians can actually deliver on a platform that makes this country more inclusive, sustainable, and fair. To accomplish this, Democrats need to find ways to win over some of the people who voted for Trump not because they are committed to Maga, but out of frustration with the status quo. And they also need to connect with many more of those millions of people who chose the couch. Instead of listening to the Liz Cheney-loving consulting class and the cable ad-buying gurus at Future Forward, Democrats need to muster the kind of political determination that drove Susie Wiles to swing Florida firmly to the right and enabled Republicans to paint Texas a deep red. You can bet that conservative strategists are thinking about how to eat away at Democratic strongholds, including California. Where’s the 10-year plan to flip Texas and its 40 electoral votes back to blue? The problem isn’t just a lack of vision or political will, but resources. The big money bundlers and special interests don’t want to cede control. According to Way to Win’s Gavito, the aftermath of Trump’s first victory brought together an unlikely coalition of Democratic donors, many of whom were not particularly liberal, let alone progressive, but who were concerned about threats to democracy and craving a return to normalcy. After Joe Biden won, many ceased to collaborate or invest in base-building efforts, wary of strategies aimed at empowering diverse working-class voters or delivering the kind of progressive policy measures that might appeal to them. Perhaps, now, some of these donors will realize that their cautious, center-hewing strategy has failed and reassess their approach. But changes at the top won’t be enough if they’re not tethered to change on the ground. Voter outreach needs to be people- and place-centered, not data- and advertiser-driven. It needs to be issue-focused and year-round, not scaled in eight weeks and gone overnight. And it must offer more than an awkward conversation at the door and an alienating avalanche of texts treating recipients like little more than ATMs. People need a sense of belonging and a compelling and credible vision of a future worth fighting for. In the end, the fate of democracy is too precious to leave in the hands of the Democratic party. Across the country, ordinary people are building the relationships, organizations, and power required to move this country forward. They are the ground game we need."

        "Titre": "Mind your language: how learning French helped me remove the condom from the wine | Susan McDonald",
        "Auteur": "Susan McDonald",
        "Date": "2025-01-05",
        "Texte": "When I was 17 my family visited France. One night in a restaurant in the Loire Valley, I summoned up my high-school French and ordered poulain, assuming it was some kind of chicken (poulet). The snooty garçon (it was the 80s, that’s what we called him) was quick to put me in my place: “Does mademoiselle know she has ordered horsemeat?” Mademoiselle did not. Fast forward 40 years to another family holiday, this time in Paris with my own children. Holding my own this time (or so I thought) with the serveur, I asked if there were any organic wines – “sans préservatifs?”. He smiled and explained that préservatif is French for condom. I took it as a small victory that the waiter laughed with me this time, not at me. And in my defence such faux amis (similar words with different meanings) trip up even the illustrious – remember France’s President Emmanuel Macron describing the former Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull’s wife, Lucy, as delicious (délicieuse can mean delightful). But it was further proof that my grasp on the language hadn’t improved much in four decades. My vocabulary is so limited I often take the coward’s way out and resort to franglais. I stumble over whether to use the imperfect or passé composé; the subjunctive I mostly don’t even attempt. I can’t for the life of me get my tongue around the r in rue and my cent, sans and s’en all sound exactly the same, when I’m sure they shouldn’t. Yet despite all the faux pas, I persist. I gave my French a red-hot go on that last trip to Paris, even managed a discussion of the pension age with a very forgiving cab driver. What I lacked in fluency, I made up for in enthusiasm and hand gestures. It’s satisfying when you can bridge the language divide but beyond the practicalities of communication there are other reasons not to give up French: 1. It opens the door to French culture, history, politics, film and literature. You can escape the Anglosphere for a bit – keep up with the latest political crisis in Paris, read a French novel, watch the French thriller Lupin on TV. And translation can only get you so far. It’s an art, not a science, so inevitably an interpretation; English translators can’t even agree on the famous first line of À la recherche du temps perdu. If you want to read Proust as it was written, you have to read it in French. 2. Learning French can help your English. It’s estimated about 40% of English words are derived from French; they crossed the Channel with William the Conqueror in 1066. Many are obvious (that’s why French Wordle isn’t as difficult as you might think) and in my conversation class we can often guess the French word based on the English. Others are less apparent – I only recently realised the connection between inevitable and éviter (to avoid/prevent). And there are many French words and phrases to use if you can’t find le mot juste (exactly the right word) in English. A sudden feeling of excitement or fear? Frisson. The sense of purpose that gets you up in the morning? Raison d’être. 3. The French take their language seriously – and that appeals to a longtime subeditor like me. Ever since the revolutionary era writer Antoine de Rivarol opined “Ce qui n’est pas clair n’est pas français” (“If it’s not clear, it’s not French”), French has had a near-mythical reputation for being precise. I’m not sure it deserves it – languages tend to be as precise as they need to be – but there certainly are a lot of grammatical rules and conventions lying in wait to trip up the novice. And a watchdog, L’Académie française, to defend them. 4. There’s just something alluring about learning a foreign language. Dare I say I think it’s the foreignness? But I need a French word to explain: dépayser (literally to “uncountry”). It’s the feeling you get, when you travel far from home and out of your comfort zone, of being unsettled and charmed at the same time. Unsettled is how I feel when I struggle to make myself understood in French or when I can’t keep up with the torrent of unintelligible words from a native speaker. But I’m charmed when I manage to carry on a conversation. I’m charmed when I discover a French word or idiom is the same as in English – bulldog is bouledogue! – but also by the differences. “I’m missing you” in French is “tu me manques”, literally “you are missing to me”. The frame of reference has shifted and there’s an alternate way of thinking about the world, a parallel linguistic universe. Perhaps that’s what Charlemagne meant when he said: “To have a second language is to possess a second soul.” Of course I’m far from being at second-soul level. I only hope my French teacher, if he reads this, doesn’t find too many glaring errors. • Susan McDonald is a news producer for Guardian Australia and a freelance writer • This article was amended on 6 January 2025 to add an accent to dépayser, an s to tu me manques and to add in two cedillas that were missing."

        "Titre": "South Africa school language law stirs Afrikaans learning debate",
        "Auteur": "Rachel Savage Southern Africa correspondent",
        "Date": "2024-09-15",
        "Texte": "A contentious South African education law has drawn furious condemnation from politicians and campaigners who claim it is putting Afrikaans education under threat while evoking for others an enduring association of the language with white minority rule. The Basic Education Laws Amendment Act was signed into law on Friday by the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who said he would give dissenting parties in his coalition government three months to suggest alternatives to two sections that give provincial officials the powers to override admission decisions and force schools to teach in more than one of South Africa’s 12 official languages. The provisions have meanwhile been welcomed by those who say they are necessary in order to stop some government schools using language to racially exclude children. The controversy has tapped into multiple sensitive political topics in South Africa: forcing children to learn in languages they don’t understand, the enduring association for some of the Afrikaans language with apartheid, persistent racial inequalities and the parlous state of many schools. “We have seen cases of learners being denied admissions to schools because of their language policies,” Ramaphosa, the leader of the African National Congress, the country’s largest party, said before signing the bill, which was passed before May’s elections. “The bill is part of the states’ ongoing effort to build an education system that is more effective and more equitable.” The Democratic Alliance (DA), which gets the majority of its support from white voters and is the second largest party in South Africa’s coalition government, threatened legal action if mother-tongue schooling was not protected after the three-month negotiation period. “Afrikaans-medium schools constitute less than 5% of the country’s schools,” said the DA’s leader and agriculture minister, John Steenhuisen, referring to schools that teach only in Afrikaans. “Their existence in no way contributes to the crisis in education, and turning them into dual-medium or English-medium schools will not help improve the quality of education for South Africa’s learners.” Afrikaans evolved from the Dutch settlers around Cape Town, as well as African and south-east Asian enslaved people, local Indigenous people and their mixed-race Cape Coloured descendants. Some of the first texts in Afrikaans were written in Arabic script by Cape Malay Muslim scholars in the early 19th century. Language and education have a tortuous history in South Africa. When the Boer war ended in 1902, Afrikaans became a form of resistance among white Afrikaners to British colonial rule and English education. After Afrikaner nationalists took power in 1948, with policies including intentionally making segregated black schools worse, the language became identified with white minority rule. In 1976, hundreds of children were shot dead by police in the Soweto uprising when they marched peacefully against the imposition of Afrikaans tuition in schools. According to census data, the number of South Africans speaking Afrikaans at home rose from 5.9 million in 1996 to 6.6 million in 2022, with the majority of speakers non-white. But by share of the population the figure has fallen from 14.5% to 10.6%, and some Afrikaner rights groups argue they are losing their language, culture and identity. “For our cultural community it’s essential that we have schools where there is Afrikaans education, it’s used as the language of tuition and that it should be monolingual schools,” said Alana Bailey, the head of cultural affairs at Afriforum, which she said campaigns for minority rights, rejecting accusations of racism. Since apartheid ended, many black parents living near the limited number of good historically white schools have tried to send their children there. In some cases this has resulted in officials trying to force Afrikaans-only schools to also teach in English, with legal battles reaching the constitutional court. “There were historically quite a few Afrikaans schools that were not full to capacity and would use language provision as a way to create barriers to access,” said Brahm Fleisch, a professor of education at the University of the Witwatersrand, expressing his support for the new law as a safeguard. “When schools are full and there’s no evidence of discrimination on the basis of race … schools are not compelled to change their language policy.” South Africa’s constitution guarantees the right to education in an official language of choice where “reasonably practicable”. But Marius Swart, a language policy expert at the University of Stellenbosch, said the lack of state capacity meant mother-tongue education in indigenous languages was still a distant dream for many children. Meanwhile, most of South Africa’s children continue to struggle in school. In 2021, a survey found that 81% of 10-year-olds could not read for understanding. “We still, to a very large extent, have a stratified school system with a relatively small elite of rich schools,” Swart said. “With relatively rich children from relatively rich families attending them and then many, many children who are in … poorly resourced schools and who really struggle.”"

        "Auteur": "Tom Hunt",
        "Date": "2024-11-02",
        "Texte": "The love of my life doesn’t cook often, but when she does, she batch-cooks the most wonderful and comforting soups, stews and bolognese. She’ll often cook a vat of bolognese in the pressure cooker to serve with pasta, upcycle into chilli (by adding beans and cayenne), or to make lasagne. Like many stewed and baked dishes, lasagne tastes even better the next day, either reheated or (my favourite) enjoyed cold in a slab as a snack. For the ultimate treat, however, try deep-frying the leftovers, because the umami-rich insides turn extra-gooey, and create the most marvellous juxtaposition of textures against the crunchy crust. The lasagne needs to be at least partially frozen to breadcrumb it, so keep your leftovers in the freezer, to deep-fry as and when required. Deep-fried lasagne There’s not much more delicious than lasagne, except maybe deep-fried lasagne. Everything is delicious fried, not least because it creates incredible textures, and satisfies the primal desire for fat and energy, all of which help make fried food so wonderfully comforting. At home, we like to batch-cook three large lasagnes at a time, then have one for dinner, one for the fridge for later in the week and one for the freezer. That way, we usually have some leftover lasagne in the freezer to deep-fry at some point when we feel like a real treat. Serves 2-4 1 small frozen homemade lasagne (about 400g) Oil, for frying 4-8 tbsp plain flour 1 egg, beaten 4-8 tbsp breadcrumbs Defrost the lasagne for 30 minutes to an hour, until it’s soft enough to cut into four squares, and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. Fill a saucepan big enough to hold all four pieces of lasagne at once with 1-2cm of frying oil and put on a medium heat. Keeping an eye on the oil, put the plain flour in a small bowl, the beaten egg in a second bowl and the breadcrumbs in a third bowl. Dredge each block of lasagne in the flour to coat, then dip it in the egg and finally turn in the breadcrumbs to cover. When the oil is hot but not smoking, carefully lower in the lasagne pieces one by one, then fry for about five minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried lasagne to an oven tray and bake for 15 minutes, until hot right through."

        "Date": "2024-10-31",
        "Texte": "The budget is alarming for not-for-profit social care providers because it will put us under pressure to meet the increases in tax costs across our workforce. Our initial analysis indicates that the changes to national insurance will cost us £5m next year. In addition to this, the increase in the national living wage will increase our wage bill by £10.2m and give us less scope to maintain differentials between entry-level and more experienced colleagues, which is vital to retain them. The NHS has received a huge amount of funding – £21bn over two years – compared to a mere £600m split between children’s and adult social care. This won’t be enough to cover the increased costs we’ll face, and we will be reliant on uplifts from local government commissioners to pay for these increases. From what we can see, the budget does not provide the extra funding local authorities will need to support this. We need funding now to help us recruit more staff and stabilise the sector. This budget adds to the financial pressure we already face. It is very clear that the actions taken in this budget do not match the rhetoric from the Department of Health and Social Care since the election about the need to fix the social care sector. We welcomed the government’s fair pay agreement, but this isn’t likely to be implemented for another two years. We need action now, rather than more promises of tomorrow. Rachael Dodgson Chief executive, Dimensions • Hourglass, the only UK-wide charity dedicated to ending the abuse, harm, exploitation and neglect of older people, is deeply concerned about the detrimental impact that national insurance increases will have on essential service provision. We had hoped that the third sector would be exempt from such damaging changes, including the reduction in the secondary threshold. With a rapidly ageing population meaning that an estimated 9.6 million more older people will be in the UK by 2050, it’s clear that our specialist support services are going to be needed more, not less. This budget puts yet another hurdle in front of services that are in desperate need of support. We urge the chancellor to think again.

        "Titre": "Meet the Rees-Moggs review – my obsession with Jacob’s wife runs deep ",
        "Auteur": "Lucy Mangan",
        "Date": "2024-12-02",
        "Texte": "I often feel these days that I am going bonkers. Or that I am staying sane while the world goes bonkers around me, which amounts to the same thing. It is getting to the point where I will almost miss being disoriented if it ever stops. There is no danger of that, however, for as long as Meet the Rees-Moggs exists. Yes, it is a reality show about the former Tory MP for North East Somerset, once described as “a haunted Victorian pencil”, Jacob Rees-Mogg, his wife, Helena, and their six children. “We had to try five times before we got one who looked like me,” says Helena, and she is right. Helena, I hazard a guess, is always right. Do you know what I would do if I were a rich politician, had married an aristocratic heiress who was even richer, and had a lovely life split between a large house in London and a vast family pile for my massive family in Somerset? Not sign up to a reality show like an absolute berk, that’s what. The why of it is a compelling question. On the one hand, a lust for fame does not jibe with what we know of poshos. On the other hand, anyone who puts together a persona as carefully as Jacob has over the years – and he is his own pastiche – is hardly someone not crying out for attention. Perhaps he thinks the show will do for him what appearing on Have I Got News for You did for Boris Johnson back in the day – make enough of the public fall for the act, and rise to power on that misbegotten popularity. If it works, we’ll deserve it. Once the show begins, however, the why fades to a background hum as the Rees-Moggery begins. Contrary to expectations, Jacob seems overtly fond of and engaged with his children (three at home, three at boarding school). His daughter, Mary, says she often teaches him slang to amuse herself. “So,” we hear him ask her later at the dinner table, “‘wasteman’ is not rizz?” I’m not sure Helena gives any of her brood a thought if they are not in her eyeline, which I admire tremendously. Helena quickly becomes the star of the show. The general election is announced. “The mood in the country,” she says, without moving her lips or jaw, “is anti-Conservative. Possibly with some justification, unfortunately.” It’s incredible. The words get out, but you cannot see how. The birthday of their fourth (I think) child, Anselm, falls on the day of Boris Johnson’s 60th birthday party, to which they are all going. Helena wonders if Anselm might want to do something in addition. Go-karting, he suggests. Helena computes this and agrees. Later, she preps the children for the likely outcome of the election. “Other careers are available.” Her wit is so dry it leaves you feeling sandpapered. I think she may become my new obsession. The Rees-Moggs’ Catholicism is covered. “I’m very lucky to have my own chapel,” says Jacob, but there are plenty of truthful and non-risible remarks about the faith, too, plus an oddly endearing discussion with the children when one wonders whether transubstantiation isn’t a bit like, you know, cannibalism? Their courtship is covered. She knew him as her friend Annunziata’s brother. He knew her as a descendant of one of his greatest political heroes, Thomas Wentworth. He told her all about him. “I staggered away after about 20 minutes,” says Helena (somehow, I still haven’t caught her in the act of enunciating). Before their first date, he tried to buy a book on Wentworth to give her, but it wasn’t in stock. So he bought her a pair of earrings instead – a move that suggests a degree of spontaneity in the Moggsian mind that is otherwise invisible. They both wanted lots of children, and that was that. Theirs is clearly a love match, though the L-word is never mentioned. His face lights up when she talks and especially when she teases him. But the unexpectedly appealing scenes of their domestic life (yes, replete with staff and everything else you would have if you were sitting on a fortune, but also with children making jokes about poo, and Helena, to whom I have pledged allegiance by the end of episode two, delivering brutal apercus at every turn) contrast with interviews with people such as David Leverton. He is on the streets campaigning in the run-up to the election against Mogg and urging tactical voting to get him out. “Almost everything he stands for is bad,” he says, of the anti-abortion, pro-Brexit, anti-immigration MP. “He seems to despise people who are poorer [than he is] – which is almost all of us.” It is more than the Have I Got News for You team threw at Johnson. Whether it is enough to counteract the idiosyncratically charming picture painted elsewhere, we will have to wait and see. • Meet the Rees-Moggs is on Discovery+ now."

        "Titre": "French government faces first major test over deep budget cuts",
        "Auteur": "Angelique Chrisafis in Paris and agencies",
        "Date": "2024-10-11",
        "Texte": "The new French government is facing its first major test in a hostile parliament as it tries to push through a budget of spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthy and big companies aimed at saving €60bn (£50bn) and reining in a ballooning fiscal deficit. The rightwing prime minister, Michel Barnier – who was appointed last month by Emmanuel Macron in an attempt to end the political paralysis following an inconclusive snap election – said France was facing a debt crisis and had to act. The finance minister, Antoine Armand, told journalists the aim was to “reduce our deficit and contain our debt” which was needed “to protect France’s financial credibility and more broadly ensure our economic stability”. The new government is under increasing pressure from financial markets and European Union partners after tax revenues fell far short of expectations this year and spending exceeded them. But the budget squeeze, drawn up at record speed and without a parliamentary majority, has to be carefully calibrated to placate opposition parties, who could not only veto the budget bill but also band together and topple the government with a no-confidence motion. Barnier may have little choice but to accept numerous concessions to get the budget bill passed, which is unlikely before mid- to late-December. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, whose tacit support Barnier needs to survive any no-confidence motion, has already attacked a government proposal to postpone a pension increase by six months to save €4bn. Jean-Philippe Tanguy of Le Pen’s party said on Friday that the draft budget was a “house of horrors by finance ministry technocrats” and was riddled with “tax injustices”. An alliance of leftwing parties, which received the largest number of votes in the July election and said they should have taken the prime minister role, were highly critical. “This is the most violent austerity plan that this country has ever seen,” said Manuel Bompard, a lawmaker for the leftwing La France Insoumise. “It will cause French people to suffer.” In a finance committee hearing, the Green MP Eva Sas said the spending cuts were “brutal and excessive”. The Socialist MP Philippe Brun said his party agreed with taxing the richest but disagreed with targeting education by cutting 4,000 teachers. After years of Macron’s pro-business policies and tax cuts, members of his centrist party said they could reject certain tax increases if they thought they would threaten jobs and reindustrialisation. Barnier’s government denied a policy of austerity, saying they were being measured in their approach. The government has said the budget would reduce the public deficit to 5% of gross domestic product next year from 6.1% this year – higher than almost all other European countries. This is described as a first step towards bringing the shortfall into line with an EU limit of 3% in 2029. But the national fiscal watchdog, mandated by law to make sure the budget bill stacks up, said the 2025 deficit target looked “fragile” and was based on optimistic economic assumptions. Tax increases will make up one-third of the €60bn budget squeeze, with the rest coming from spending cuts across ministries. Spending on welfare, health, pensions and local governments will take targeted hits, which opposition lawmakers may be tempted to reverse in parliament. All taxpayers will be hit by plans to restore a levy on electricity consumption. If the opposition parties come out against the budget draft law, the government has the option of forcing it through without a vote under article 49.3 of the French constitution. But this would open the door to another vote of no confidence, putting Barnier at the mercy of the opposition again."

        "Titre": "What sort of society rations support for children with special learning needs? | Sonia Sodha",
        "Auteur": "Sonia Sodha",
        "Date": "2024-10-27",
        "Texte": "There’s a proliferation of acronyms assigned to children whose needs the state is struggling to meet. SEN (children with special educational needs), Neets (young people not in education, employment or training), LACs (looked after children in the care system). Sometimes it feels as though these acronyms, coined by the systems and professionals involved in supporting the children, serve to help us all collude in the idea that this is some highly technical, specialised policy conversation that sits apart from mainstream discourse about children – like how we protect them from online harm – instead of being fundamental to our assessment of whether our society is doing right by them. Last week, the National Audit Office published a damning report on the extent to which children with SEN are being failed. It’s a finding that won’t come as a surprise to any parent, child or professional with experience of a system that was racked with problems even before the 14 years of spending cuts that have affected children’s services. Before we get into that, it’s important to understand who these children are. There is something beautifully simple and child-centred about the definition of a special educational need: it means that a child has either significantly greater difficulty in learning than most other children their same age, or a disability that would prevent them from accessing mainstream school facilities. A range of conditions or circumstances might make it more difficult for a child to engage with school, from social and emotional difficulties, to speech and language difficulties, to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, ADHD and cerebral palsy. The system isn’t intended to be framed around diagnoses and labels, rather, around what a child needs to access education. And the moral imperative for those needs to be met could not be stronger; because if they are not, that amounts to writing off a child. The story often told about English schools over the past 30 or so years is one of improvement. It is certainly true that, if you take the average child, standards have risen through successive curriculum reforms introduced by Labour then Conservative governments. But there has always been a significant cohort of children whom the education system fails, who do not reach adulthood with the functional skills everyone needs not just for work but for life. Not only has policy not worked at improving outcomes for those children; everywhere you look there are signs that things are getting worse, from the widening socioeconomic attainment gap to the numbers missing school in the wake of the pandemic to teachers reporting worsening behaviour. How the education system serves those children who fall behind is not some sort of side chat: it is as important as what’s happening to average standards. Children with SEN are central to understanding that. And theirs is the story of how a beautifully simple concept has in practice become hideously complex, adversarial and destructive. There are two tracks for getting children with SEN the support they need. Schools are expected to meet the needs of most such childen from their mainstream budgets; about 13% of all pupils. For children with high levels of need, parents or schools can apply for a local authority assessment to obtain an education, health and care (EHC) plan, which sets out a statutory entitlement for extra support; about 5% of all pupils have such a plan. But, as children’s services and school budgets have become more stretched, even as need has gone up, many schools have struggled to support pupils with additional learning needs. So, for many parents, the only way to access support for their child is to get them an EHC plan. But that is a huge and often lengthy battle in itself, and in the interim children are missing key developmental milestones, which makes it harder for them to stay engaged in their learning, and means they ultimately need even more support. It is a wickedly vicious cycle that drains morale, energy, time and resource from parents fighting to have their children moved to another category as their unmet needs become more profound, while the overall resource envelope doesn’t shift: over the past decade, as more children have had ECH plans, real funding for each plan has fallen by more than a third. Children are also being forced to wait years for diagnoses for conditions such as autism, ADHD and learning difficulties while not getting the support they need in the meantime. Where resources are scarce and budgets are stretched, any two-track system is going to have this problem. It can be seen across much of the public sector. Instead of making support available to people early – for example, when they first get ill, or develop substance abuse – to prevent problems intensifying, the little support that is available is reserved for people for whom things have become absolutely dreadful, guaranteeing that this group will always exist because there is so little support available at an earlier stage. It is why any idea that there are ways to reform the public sector against a backdrop of high need without extra resources is for the birds; strictly rationing state support to children or adults in the most acute of crises is a sure-fire way of ensuring that things get worse. That’s why the National Audit Office found that there was no evidence that increased spending on children with additional needs had improved outcomes for them: need is growing more quickly than spending, partly because provision is so limited in the first place. This is the problem the new Labour government faces. Stopping the late-intervention vicious cycle takes not just reforming zeal but money. Arguably, nothing should be more important to a party that once adopted “education, education, education” as a slogan than ensuring all children get their basic human right to an education. But it’s depressing that there have been so few mentions of what children with additional learning needs might gain from the budget this week. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"

        "Titre": "Trump converts voters in deep-blue California – was it all about the economy?",
        "Auteur": "Dani Anguiano in Butte county",
        "Date": "2024-11-17",
        "Texte": "Donald Trump on 5 November expanded his coalition across the United States, and he did so even in deep-blue California. While Kamala Harris unsurprisingly beat out Trump in the Golden State – receiving about 60% of the vote – the former president nonetheless pulled off a victory, winning eight counties that supported Joe Biden in 2020. It may take years to fully understand the dynamics that contributed to the shift, but experts and political observers have so far pointed to the economy and diminished voter enthusiasm as key elements. Notorious for taking weeks to fully tally the election results, California is still finishing up its count. With more than 1m ballots left to sort through, the results could change, but as of Friday evening, Trump appears to have flipped eight counties from voting Democrat to Republican in the presidential race: Butte, Merced, Stanislaus, Fresno, San Joaquin, Inyo, San Bernardino and Riverside. The counties are concentrated in the state’s interior, from the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles to the agricultural heartland in the Central Valley. They’re generally more rural and not as progressive as population centers on the coast, and several are closely split between the parties while others are predominantly Democratic. Half of the counties backed a mix of Democrats and Republicans in US House races while one – Merced – supported a Democrat in its sole House contest. More than 1 million people voted for Trump in those areas, which are home to almost 7 million people. Polling by the Associated Press and Norc at the University of Chicago suggest that California voters saw the economy as the most important issue facing the country, ahead of immigration, the climate and abortion access. It’s a trend seen across the country, said Mark Baldassare, the survey director at the Public Policy Institute of California, with voters feeling negatively about the economy and angry and dissatisfied at those currently in power. Like in other parts of the US, Trump appears to have been able to win over a larger share of young and Latino voters than he did before – although advocacy groups disagree about precisely how significant his gains were. In California, a decisive majority of Latino voters cast their ballots for Harris. Still, Trump managed to increase his share of the vote in most Latino-majority counties in California, according to CalMatters, including Fresno and Riverside. Perceptions of the economy played a major role in the shift, organizers have said. “The most potent driver in the election was economic discontent, expressed in president-elect Donald Trump’s gains with most demographics,” Clarissa Martínez de Castro, the UnidosUS vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative, said in a statement, while emphasizing that most Latino voters backed Harris. Meanwhile, it appears turnout in California dropped from 2020, particularly among those who vote infrequently, said Baldassare. “That suggests that the more infrequent voters probably didn’t make it [and] didn’t feel motivated as they did in 2020, which of course was during the pandemic and a time of considerable political angst,” he said. Low-propensity voters that did make it to the polls may have been more motivated by the economy, Baldassare added. “That meant some people were voting for change in large enough numbers,” he said. Lisa Pruitt, a rural law expert at the University of California, Davis, said the results suggest some Californians believe the state’s policies have ventured too far left. Along with Trump’s gains, the state’s voters backed a measure to enact harsher penalties for theft and drug offenses, and rejected an effort to ban forced labor in prisons. Progressive district attorneys in Los Angeles and Oakland lost their seats. “I think a lot of Californians think the state has moved too far to the left on crime, on so-called law and order – issues. And they are seeking a correction,” she said, adding that trans rights has also become a wedge issue for some voters. A state law banning school districts from requiring parental notification if a child makes changes to their gender identification has attracted fierce backlash in conservative parts of the state and drawn national attention. “California is a bellwether of progressive politics and we are seeing a recoiling from that in our own state,” Pruitt said. But Trump’s victory in the US more broadly is part of a pattern that can be seen across the world, said James Adams, a political science professor at the University of California, Davis. Governing parties across the west, from Portugal to Finland to Germany are being voted out, and populist candidates are gaining support, Adams said. “The Republican party under Donald Trump is essentially a populist party with the message that the system is rigged and serves the interest of the rich and powerful and ignores ordinary people,” he said. “That message is one that seems to resonate across western democracies.” High inflation has eroded support for governing parties and confidence in their abilities to manage the economy, he added. Far northern California’s Butte county, which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, went to Trump. In Chico, the largest city in the county, however, voters supported Harris at similar levels they did Biden in 2020 and progressives were close to gaining a majority on the city council not seen in years. Addison Winslow, a progressive on Chico’s city council, attributes Trump’s gains to the Democratic party failing to acknowledge the economic realities for voters and put forward a candidate who people trust. “The anecdotal info I get is not that people are more conservative or more racist now or more hostile to progressive policies, but [that] the Democratic party has failed to put forward any national figures that the public trusts,” said Winslow. “What the Democrats have done is say, ‘Inflation isn’t that bad any more, the economy is actually really good,’” he said. “Maybe they can pull some economic indicators and say, ‘Look, I’m right’ but that just hasn’t been the personal experience of people.”"

        "Titre": "Learning CPR on manikins without breasts puts women’s lives at risk, study finds",
        "Auteur": "Natasha May Health reporter",
        "Date": "2024-11-21",
        "Texte": "Most CPR manikins don’t have breasts, which contributes towards women being less likely to receive life-saving first aid from bystanders, a study has found. The study led by Dr Rebecca Szabo, the lead of the Gandel Simulation Service at the Royal Women’s hospital in Melbourne, analysed all manikin models on the global market designed for adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. Of the 20 different manikins, the researchers found all them had flat torsos, with only one model having a breast overlay. Eight were identified as male and seven had no gender specified. The study, published in the journal Health Promotion International, highlights the findings as an equity issue with implications for the human right to health. Australian research published in June found women are less likely to receive life-saving CPR after cardiac arrest and less likely to survive. A survey by St John Ambulance in the UK, published in October, found women who go into cardiac arrest in public are less likely than men to receive chest compressions from bystanders as people “worry about touching their breasts”. The study suggested “unequal outcomes for women after cardiac arrest may start in CPR training and CPR manikin design related to implicit bias.” Szabo, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, embarked on her research when she could not find any CPR manikins with breasts to train healthcare workers in life support for maternal cardiac arrest in pregnancy. She was concerned as Melbourne’s Delta Covid-19 wave in 2021 was leading to sicker patients and more ICU admissions. “In the end we purchased a chest plate with breasts online,” Szabo said. “It’s similar to what a drag queen would wear and goes on like a singlet. We put that on our manikin for training.” Szabo said CPR compression technique is no different for women, and that training on manikins representative of both sexes “may help people feel more comfortable … being confronted with a bra, breasts and something different” in a real-life emergency. Breasts may also influence how defibrillator pads are applied, especially if there are breast implants or larger breasts, she said. Despite worse CPR outcomes for women being well documented, “our study shows despite this little has changed in diversity of available CPR training manikins globally”, Szabo said. “Our study is the first of its kind to name this as a gender and human rights issue linking this to business human rights and the commercial determinants of health.” The authors of the study have urged CPR training providers and manufacturers to commit to improving the diversity of CPR training manikins, which they say should be the responsibility of those organisations. “Governments, manufacturing companies, training bodies and those of us procuring and using these important training products all play an important role to address this important issue that may improve outcomes for women,” Szabo said. She said this aligned with the aims of the National Women’s Health Advisory Council, chaired by Australia’s assistant minister for health, Ged Kearney, “to tackle ‘medical misogyny’,” on a range of key concerns including cardiovascular disease. Prof Bronwyn Graham, the national director of the Centre for Sex and Gender Equity in Health and Medicine opened in March by The George Institute for Global Health, said “Szabo and colleagues’ findings are emblematic of a widespread bias in the health and medical ecosystem that has led to healthcare practices being optimised for the white male body; with detrimental and sometimes deadly implications for anyone who doesn’t fit this mould”. “It highlights the critical need for regulatory bodies at all stages of the health and medical pipeline – from fundamental research through to the tools used to educate healthcare providers – to have policies that mandate consideration of sex and gender,” she said. “Without such policies, these often insidious biases remain, and we will continue to put the lives of women and girls, and other marginalised sex and gender groups (including those with variations in sex characteristics, trans, and gender-diverse people) at risk of harm on a daily basis.”"

        "Titre": "‘A sharp learning curve’: Lewis says England players must cope with growing scrutiny",
        "Auteur": "Raf Nicholson",
        "Date": "2024-11-12",
        "Texte": "The England coach, Jon Lewis, said his players experienced a “sharp learning curve” about perception management in the fallout from their disastrous group-stage exit in last month’s T20 World Cup. The team’s fitness, professionalism and leadership were all called into question. Criticism was directed at the players when they fell apart against West Indies after their captain Heather Knight’s injury-enforced absence from the field, dropping six straightforward catches, as the team seemed to panic when Nat Sciver-Brunt took the reins. Further pointed remarks were then made about the conditioning of some players. But as the team look to the future, beginning with a multi-format series in South Africa this month, Lewis backed Sciver-Brunt to remain as vice-captain while admitting they need to work on “developing the next group of leaders” to prepare for life beyond Knight. He also defended the team’s preparation. Lewis said Sciver-Brunt was a “more than capable leader”, but refused to confirm that she would succeed Knight on a full-time basis. “There’ll be a natural point where Heather feels: ‘I’ve done all I can to take this team as far as I can.’ And then at that point, whenever that is, we’ll think about what options are available to us,” he said. “There is some work to do around developing the next group of leaders within this team. We will be making sure that there is an oversupply of leaders when we get to that point.” England have a big three months ahead, beginning in South Africa on 24 November with three T20s, three ODIs and a Test match, before the main event in January: the Women’s Ashes. Their World Cup exit was hardly ideal preparation, but despite the embarrassment of failing to reach the semi-finals, England have opted for continuity over change, with Alice Capsey the only player to be dropped from the World Cup squad. “We feel this is the best squad to take on the challenges ahead,” Lewis said. “Right now, Heather’s the best person to captain this team.” He also defended his own position as head coach, saying he felt the team had been “pushing forward in terms of our performances over the past year”. He also batted away accusations his players had overindulged during the World Cup after several Instagram posts by the team showed them enjoying boat trips, sunbathing and drinking between matches. “I’ve got an incredibly diligent and incredibly hardworking group of players who I feel get the balance right in terms of relaxing and having fun, and being able to turn off from the high pressure jobs that they do,” he said. Lewis blamed the furore about the team’s lack of fitness on their naivety about social media. “That will be a sharp learning curve for the players involved,” he said. “I really trust our players and they train incredibly hard, but the female game in particular is getting a lot more scrutiny than it ever got before. “Unfortunately for the players, that’s something that they’re going to have to think about and understand the consequence of the misconception of what they are doing and how people can misconceive a social media post.” Capsey’s omission from the T20 leg of the South Africa tour comes after a difficult year when the 20-year-old passed 50 once in 18 T20 internationals. “Her form has been trending downwards for probably the last eight to nine months,” Lewis said. “We’d like her to be a little bit more consistent. It’s a good time for her to have a little think, a little reset and come back stronger.” Dani Gibson also misses out due to recent knee surgery, though she is expected to return before the Ashes. The 28-year-old hard-hitting all-rounder Paige Scholfield has been called up as cover, after making her international debut against Ireland in September."

        "Titre": "Jess Fox: ‘Let’s throw myself in the deep end here and challenge myself’ | Nicole Jeffery",
        "Auteur": "Nicole Jeffery",
        "Date": "2024-11-09",
        "Texte": "Jess Fox has forged a dazzling career by pushing herself out of her comfort zone, but she did wonder if she had gone too far as she was about to hit the catwalk at the L’Oréal Paris Walk for Worth runway show at Sydney’s Overseas Passenger Terminal recently. “I was really nervous about it because I’m not a model,” the triple Olympic gold medallist says. “I’m not confident about that. I’m best in sneakers or even barefoot when I’m kayaking. “But then I kind of had this realisation that it wasn’t about looking like a model and strutting on the runway. It was about being myself and kind of just embracing it and having fun.” Fox, 30, has been in high demand since the Paris Olympics, where she confirmed her place as the greatest slalom canoe paddler in history by winning both the K1 and C1 gold medals, and shared one of the emotional high points of the Games with her younger sister Noémie, who completed the Fox family shutout of the women’s events by winning the kayak cross gold medal. One of Australia’s most driven and dedicated athletes for the last 15 years, Fox would normally return to the World Cup circuit post-Olympics to scoop up a few more medals and titles before the season is done, but this year she has done things differently. After what she describes as “a perfect Olympics” in Paris, she has paused to take advantage of some of the opportunities created by her sensational Games, and experience life as “a normal person” by going out to dinner with friends, eating whatever she likes on the menu and occasionally skipping a training session. However, her calendar is still filled to the brim. Before the Olympics, she signed an agreement with the Nine Network, which segued into her reading the sports news on the Today show for a week last month and being part of Nine’s Melbourne Cup Carnival coverage this week. The whirlwind began the day she landed in Sydney after the Olympics, with a photoshoot for Stellar magazine, before she attended the Logies, and then fronted up for her first breakfast shift on the Today show at 5.30am the next morning. After the Games she signed on as an ambassador for L’Oréal Paris (hence the runway show) and she also has a series of corporate engagements to fulfil for sponsors including accounting firm Grant Thornton. The sports awards season is also kicking off, with Fox already having claimed Paddle Australia’s top award and the New South Wales Office of Sport’s female athlete of the year award, with the Australian Institute of Sport and Sport Australia Hall of Fame awards still to come. For a woman who prefers to wear sneakers, she’s doing a lot of frocking up. “It’s a mixture of things that had been planned before Paris and then other opportunities that have come up since the Games that have been really exciting, very challenging, very different things like Channel Nine and the Today show. I was like, wow, OK, that’s exciting. Yes, let’s do it. Let’s throw myself in the deep end here and challenge myself.” Four-times Olympian Fox won her first gold medal in Tokyo in 2021 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, when there were far fewer commercial opportunities available, so she kept her head down and focused on her sport. This time she has put her head up and had a look around at what might be available for her post-sports career. “Paris has been a huge shift, and I really noticed that in my life, for sure, compared to Tokyo,” she says. “And I’m also in a stage in my career where the post-career preparation is on my mind. And so I want to be doing these things, and dabbling in different areas that interest me, whether that’s in media or fashion or conferences and things like that. I’ve enjoyed the variety for sure.” Which is not to say that Fox is thinking of retiring any time soon. She is committed to at least one more Olympics, in Los Angeles in 2028, and beyond that there is the carrot of a home Olympics in Brisbane in 2032, when she would be 38. That’s still within the medal age range for canoe slalom champions. Her mother and coach Myriam Jerusalmi-Fox won her only Olympic medal at 34, while 38-year-old Maialen Chourraut of Spain won a silver medal in Tokyo. But the younger Fox expects to take her career year-by-year after Los Angeles. “I haven’t ruled out [Brisbane], but I also see that it could be my opportunity to be part of the Olympics in a different way. I will be there. Whether or not it’s on the start line, I’ll be in Brisbane to enjoy a home Olympics in one way or another and be able to give back if I’m not competing. “I’ve always said that for as long as I feel like the body is there and I’m committed and willing and motivated to train to the level that is required to perform at my best, and I still love it – because that’s a big one, to have the love – then I’ll keep going. But I think I’ve also always said that I want to go out on top. I don’t want to be hanging on and just doing it because it’s all I’ve ever known.” Fox was elected to the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes Commission for an eight-year term in Paris, so at the very least she will be in Brisbane in that capacity, and she will have to include monthly commission meetings in her schedule for the next two Olympiads. She also doubts that even a home Games could live up to her extraordinary experience in Paris. She was one of Australia’s opening ceremony flag-bearers, won two individual gold medals and then watched in elation as Noémie clinched her own gold medal. She’s still somewhat speechless in trying to describe what that experience meant to their family. “We still can’t believe it sometimes, that we both did it, and it was just such a dream,’’ Fox says. “I feel like I need more words to be able to describe it, but I just don’t have them yet. But the feeling of those two weeks, what we lived, as a team, as sisters, as a family, it was truly such a unique and special experience that I don’t think anything will ever compare to that pride and joy that I felt watching her win and being able to share it together.” The satisfaction is immense but the Foxes do not rest on their laurels. Their home training course, Penrith Whitewater Stadium, west of Sydney, has been named as the host venue for next year’s world championships, and the whole family is invested in making the event a success for Australia. Father and former world champion Richard Fox has been appointed head of the event organising committee, while Myriam, Jess and Noémie will focus their efforts on the performance side. Fox says the lure of the home championships would propel her back into full training by the end of the year. “I think a lot of athletes feel that sort of lull in motivation after such a big campaign or achieving the dream goal of an Olympic gold, so for me, that’s great, because it’s something exciting to work towards,” she says. “Having a home world champs is so rare, it’s once in a career, so I’m really looking forward to that.” The world championships allows three paddlers to compete per nation in the individual events, and also includes a team event, so both sisters will be able to compete across the program – a luxury they don’t have at Olympic level. “I want to be on my A game for that,” Fox says. On that stage she knows how to strut."

        "Titre": "From brutalist school to space-age church: the architectural oasis deep in Trump country",
        "Auteur": "Oliver Wainwright",
        "Date": "2024-12-09",
        "Texte": "Imagine growing up in a place where every stage of your life was framed by the best architecture of its day. You start out in an experimental elementary school, learning on a multi-level landscape of open-plan terraces connected by slides, before moving to a junior school where little towers of classrooms are linked by brightly coloured sloping tunnels. You spend your high school years in a heroic piece of brutalism, attend university in a sleek glass temple and go to church in a space-age tipi. Your libraries, banks and even the local discount store are all the work of notable architects, and if your house is ever set ablaze, firefighters will come from a famous fire station, designed by a Pritzker prize winner. If you end up in jail, rest assured you will be incarcerated in a work of high postmodernism. And you may even die in a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired hospital, then have your ashes scattered in the shadow of an Eero Saarinen-designed chapel. Such a place exists – and it’s situated where you would least expect to find it. Set in the middle of the rolling agricultural plains of Indiana, a landscape dotted with “Farmers for Trump” billboards and White Castle hamburger outposts, the small city of Columbus makes for an unlikely modernist mecca. “Seldom, if ever, has so small a community contained so many examples of innovative architectural achievements,” declared the New York Times in 1970, noting that Columbus had been building at least “two masterpieces a year” since the early 1950s. Locals took to calling it “the Athens of the prairie”, and it’s a reputation the place has continued to uphold ever since. The city’s many masterpieces, and the fascinating stories behind them, have now been brought together in a hefty tome, American Modern, authored by an architecture writer who grew up here. “I walked past the Saarinen church every day on my way to school,” says Matt Shaw, whose detailed text is accompanied by photographs by Iwan Baan, which celebrate the buildings as well-used backdrops to everyday small-town life. “My high school was actually part of the reason the contemporary architecture programme began,” Shaw adds, “because no one liked it.” The programme he refers to was initiated by Joseph Irwin Miller, a wealthy industrialist and social reformer, who held an evangelical belief in the power of architecture to improve society. From the 1940s onwards, he worked to transform his family’s business, the Cummins Engine Company, into the world’s largest manufacturer of diesel engines, with $6bn in annual sales. To do so, he had to attract the best engineers from around the world, which, in turn, meant turning Columbus into the “very best community of its size in the country”, with the best schools, staffed by the best teachers, and the best civic buildings and parks, all built with the aim of “attracting good people to Columbus in all capacities”. The plan wasn’t to turn it into a company town, like the Victorian paternalist visions of Bourneville or Saltaire in the UK. Instead, the city itself was the client, and paid for these public buildings as usual, but the Cummins Engine Foundation covered the architects’ fees – as long as they were selected from a list it provided, of the best designers of the day. “We believe nothing is more expensive than mediocrity,” the foundation stated, “and that good design need not cost any more than bad design.” The architects were given at least a year to work up the plans, with responsibility for the building, interior finishes and furnishings, and recommending landscaping, “so that the building, inside and out is planned and designed in aesthetic harmony”. And if there was an extension planned to a building in future, its original architect would get first refusal – an almost unheard-of contractual perk. The initiative was a clever ruse, not only to produce the best buildings, but to turn the city into a place where the top architects all wanted to work, each upping their game in the knowledge they would be judged alongside their best competitors. Columbus often managed to snag designers early in their careers, mindful that the more established celebrity names came with big egos and little patience. Frank Lloyd Wright was never on the list for this reason. Walking around town, you find the results are as unexpected as they are varied. The public library – designed in 1966 by the Chinese-American architect IM Pei, who went on to build the glass pyramid at the Louvre – looks like a humble brick box. But step inside, and a powerful interior sequence unfolds beneath a concrete waffle slab ceiling, with reading areas placed at different levels around lush indoor gardens. It stands across from a pared-back cubic church by Eliel Saarinen, father of Eero, built in 1942 as one of the first modernist religious structures in the US, with pews designed by a young Charles Eames. Pre-dating the Cummins Foundation’s architecture programme, it is the building that triggered the city’s modernist wave, and the first design that the young Miller influenced. Returning home from his studies at Yale and Oxford, he found his parents discussing the choice of architect. “Mother, I don’t see why you talk about a gothic church or an early American church,” he quipped. “We are not gothic or early American.” Mother was appalled. But the congregation went on to select the Finnish American modernist, setting the city’s progressive tone for the rest of the century. A block away stands the low-slung Miesian pavilion of the former Irwin Union Bank, designed by the younger Saarinen in 1954, as a vision of democratic banking. It was intended to feel more like a welcoming country store than the usual fortress-like places of dark woodwork and tellers protected behind cages. It was a place of big windows and open counters, with a roof of shallow domes and a basketweave brick floor, intended to make farmers or factory workers feel comfortable walking in their mucky work boots. Complete with a drive-thru section, it set a new direction for postwar bank design, influencing thousands of branches across the country. Two miles north, near a dream home he designed for the Millers, stands Saarinen’s other major contribution to Columbus. It couldn’t be more different. A hexagonal slate tent appears to hover above the grassy landscape, as if ready for take-off, rising to a pointed steel spire that shoots 60 metres into the air. Designed in the 1960s, at the same time that he was working on St Louis’s Gateway Arch and the TWA Terminal in New York, North Christian Church bears a similar level of structural ambition. “When I face St Peter,” Saarinen wrote to Miller, pleading for more time to work on the design, “I [want to be] able to say that out of the buildings I did in my lifetime, one of the best was this little church.” He died suddenly, before it was completed, but he received his wish. The congregation has dwindled, but the building will soon enjoy a new, deconsecrated lease of life as an outpost of the public library. These postcard sites are impressive and they provided photogenic locations for the 2017 film Columbus, in which they almost become characters in the story. But it is the public schools, dotted around the edge of the city, that show the true power of what the Cummins architecture programme could do. Often authored by architects who had worked for Saarinen, they show a real belief in the radical educational thinking of the 1960s and 70s. From John Johansen’s zig-zagging network of colourful corrugated tunnels at L Francis Smith Elementary, to Hugh Hardy’s rainbow symphony of ducts and pipes at Mount Healthy Elementary, to the great space-frame roof of Paul Kennon’s Fodrea Community School, designed in collaboration with pupils (hence the slide, now sadly fenced off), they stand as physical manifestations of the progressive ideals of the time. Pioneers of their day, they would go on to influence a generation of open-plan learning environments. “Columbus was not just about tasteful mid-century modernism, as some people assume,” says Shaw. “It was also about using the best ideas around global technological progress to deliver on the promise of a better world.” And these school buildings didn’t cost any more than the usual kind. They were often cheaper. Miller died in 2004, and subsequent years haven’t spawned quite such exciting results. Projects have gone to big corporate firms, like Perkins &amp; Will, Pelli Clarke Pelli and Koetter Kim, rather than untested names. But a recent shortlist to design a new air traffic control tower at the airport cast a wider net, and was won by the Arkansas architect Marlon Blackwell, suggesting a new direction. The Landmark Columbus foundation, which commissioned the book, also organises a biennial architectural festival here, Exhibit Columbus, which brings a diverse cohort of architects to town and helps to raise awareness of the city’s heritage, encouraging its current custodians to aim high. At a time when a second Trump administration threatens to revive its neoclassical diktats for federal buildings, the Columbus model shows just how important it is for cities to fight for the best public architecture of our time. • American Modern is out now"

        "Titre": "Keir Starmer optimistic for ‘deep’ reset of relations with Ireland",
        "Auteur": "Lisa O'Carroll",
        "Date": "2024-09-07",
        "Texte": "Keir Starmer has said he believes there can be a “deep” reset of relations with Ireland after arriving in Dublin for his first official visit, with Northern Ireland, Brexit and joint international interests on the agenda. It is the first official visit of a British prime minister since Boris Johnson visited in 2019 to try to salvage a Brexit deal after years of strained relations. Five years on, the mood was optimistic as Starmer was greeted by the taoiseach, Simon Harris. “It’s a pleasure to be here, to have this opportunity that we will take to renew the friendship between our two countries,” he said. “That reset, I think, can be meaningful, it can be deep. Of course, it covers the relationship between our two countries. Obviously it has to cover the Good Friday agreement and I take very seriously our joint role in relation to that.” It is Starmer’s second time meeting Harris in the nine weeks since the general election, a sign of the “real intention” to reset relationships to the “great benefit” of the UK and Ireland, Starmer said. He said pressing international issues including Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East were also on the agenda for the meeting. “In relation to the Middle East, we need a ceasefire so that the remaining hostages can come out, so that desperately-needed aid can get in to Gaza, and that we can step down the path towards a two-state settlement, which in my view is the only lasting settlement that will bring about lasting peace,” the prime minister said. Harris has said Ireland and Britain have a “collective wish to see a cessation of violence in Gaza”. Before going in for their talks, they met nine-year-old Freddie Munnelly from Castleknock in Dublin, who had a liver transplant in the UK. The young boy gave the two leaders scarves to wear at the Ireland v England football match at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday evening. The two leaders will participate in a business roundtable in Dublin with representatives of Primark, diary giant Ornua and Dawn Meats among others to explore how a “reset” in relations can benefit trade. Earlier on Saturday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, told the British Irish Association in Oxford that he was committed to implementing the Brexit protocols for Northern Ireland in full in order to show EU capitals they were also serious about a reset in the EU deal including the securing of a veterinary agreement. “We will implement the Windsor framework [the Northern Ireland trading arrangements] with pragmatic good faith, not least because we need to do so in order to be able to negotiate a veterinary agreement with the European Union, but also in order to protect the open border on the island of Ireland.” However, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Micheál Martin, said there would be no “à la carte” choices for the UK in that reset just because there was a more pro-European government in power in the UK."

        "Titre": "‘I’ve stumbled deep into alien territory’: our sportswriters and arts critics swap jobs",

        "Texte": "Plenty unites the Guardian’s sports reporters and cultural critics. Both make a living observing the apex of physicality. They have to make sense of what they’ve seen at lightning speed to meet deadlines. So why not swap gigs for the day? The sports team were delighted to be working in warm venues; the critics unabashed about their disregard for the rules of the game. But more importantly, genuinely striking insights ensued, whether about Elton John’s appearance at Dua Lipa’s gig being the equivalent of Aston Villa making a Hail Mary sub of Jhon Durán, or the rugby ball being like a black hole sucking the players into its orbit. Perhaps we need to open transfer season between desks more often. Laura Snapes You don’t get this at Exeter v Sale. Rock’n’roll, baby! Becky Hill at Exeter Westpoint Arena, 18 October, by rugby union correspondent Robert Kitson Reporting on sport and live music should be pretty similar, right? Noisy crowds, eye-catching talent, a diversion from the heavy-lifting of serious news. Hmm. This is the first time I’ve turned up for work to find an angry-looking fire blazing at the venue and staff already scraping projectile vomit off the carpet in the foyer. You don’t get this at Exeter v Sale. Rock’n’roll, baby! I fish out my notebook and briefly pretend to be a proper journalist. Luckily, the fire – caused by a lifting truck bursting into flames – is swiftly extinguished and the show can go on. Someone has poured heaps of absorbent spill powder on the diced carrot, which is helpful. Nothing like a sticky floor to remind you of dodgy student gigs back in the day. This may also be the time to start plotting an exit strategy. When Lewis Capaldi played here early last year, some punters complained of a three-hour queue to leave the car park. On the upside, at least some starrier names are now visiting Exeter. The majority turn their tour buses around at Bristol or Bournemouth, seemingly content to leave the rest of the West Country to chew straw and talk to our animals. That said, with the gig already under way, surprising numbers of people are still tucking into pints of cider outside. This site also plays host to the Devon county show, the annual highlight of the local agricultural calendar, and is in no imminent danger of being mistaken for the Royal Albert Hall. So fair play to Becky Hill for rising above it all. Our down-to-earth dance diva already merits our thanks. But no matter how local, some of us have stumbled deep into alien territory. “Are you ready for the Afterglow, Exeter?” Hill shrieks once we’re inside. Eh? Judging by the forest of mobile phones being thrust into the air, everyone else knows her back catalogue slightly better than me. And, look, maybe every reviewer should be required to declare the last three gigs they have personally paid to see. Some would argue my guitar-driven trio – Billy Bragg, the War on Drugs, Del Amitri – does not ideally qualify me to pontificate on the UK dance diva’s long-awaited first arena tour. “Have you listened to the album?” Hill asks her audience, rather plaintively, at one stage. Maybe she’s spotted my phone is still in my pocket? The digested read? Hill seems genuinely nice, if slightly reluctant to attempt a few more dance moves à la Dua Lipa and, potentially, elevate her show to another stratosphere. She has fabulous hair and, even in a big metal shed in deepest Devon on a damp Friday night, she can definitely sing. The crowd mostly seem to be appreciative without ever going bonkers. “Are you ready to fucking party?” implores our heroine, still seeking more energy. It is easy to see her connecting with serious clubbers on a steamy night in Ibiza. But they don’t have to contend with our looming car park hell. Good luck for the rest of the tour, Becky, and mind that vomit on the way out. If this were theatre, it would be a West End extravaganza NFL: New England Patriots v Jacksonville Jaguars, Wembley Stadium, 20 October, by chief theatre critic Arifa Akbar All drama is based on conflict. Without it, there is no action or story. As a theatre critic, I know this mantra well. But it is not until I arrive at the heaving splendour of Wembley stadium for my first live NFL game that I remember it can equally be about spectacle. The opening moments contain the ceremonial splash of a state parade. Men in military-style uniforms march up to the sidelines. A massive union jack and star-spangled banner are unfurled. It is candy-floss pomp: this is not a contest of two nations and the stakes are low because neither Patriots nor Jaguars have qualified for next year’s Super Bowl. But if this sublime and ridiculous pre-game scene-setting is to rouse, dazzle and distract from that fact, it does its job. An adrenalised Jaguar mascot bungee-jumps above the field while players run out of the mouth of a cartoon wildcat. If this were theatre, it would be a lavish West End extravaganza produced by Sonia Friedman with Netflix or Disney money behind it. It has the immaculate choreography of a musical: the cheerleaders shake their pom-poms and swoosh their hair and gather for an arrow-shaped “roar” – a modern can-can that is as high-octane as the mascot’s antics. The players crouch in runners’ postures before each burst of action. Across three hours, the game has a staccato drama: tension comes in plosive point-scoring. It could drag were it not for the moving parts. There is a contemporaneous commodification of the live event on the screens, which flash with adverts, instructions, player closeups and recaps. Comperes juggle between commentary and entertaining the crowd with the elongated words of WWE ring announcers. If this is about performance, it is about the performance of masculinity, too. The players are the mythic heroes who range timelessly across the literary canon, from Arthur Miller’s Biff Loman (Death of a Salesman) and Tennessee Williams’ Brick (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) to F Scott Fitzgerald’s Yale football champ, Tom Buchanan, and Philip Roth’s Jewish sporting hero, the Swede, who shows us that football is one way the “outsider” can become wholesomely all-American. Its allure is clear to see on this field, with players who look like modern-day gladiators. Here is star quarterback Trevor Lawrence, with his Samson-like locks; Evan Engram, with tattooed sleeves that look like William Wallace’s war-paint; and Parker Washington, who brings the most scintillating moment of the game with a 96-yard punt return. They are like gods in their own realm, aloof and apart from the tinsel around them. They have purity of purpose, and their defensive or offensive moves are overt displays of aggression. The crisis of masculinity increasingly explored in stories on stage is nowhere to be seen here. The old-school hero is fully intact on this field. I have always found the tribalism of team sports unnerving; it seems to me like a real-life conflict between us and them. As a child of immigrants, growing up in the racially hostile Britain of the 1980s, team sport seemed like proof of belonging, or otherwise, with fury on the football terraces and the definitive either/or of Norman Tebbit’s cricket test. That might be an anachronism now, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste. Yet I have felt the power of this tribalism, too, rooting for the Pakistani cricket team as a way of asserting my heritage, and for Arsenal in childhood allegiance to north London. It is different here, though. Supporters sit among each other, many colours in one block: a man in a Lawrence jersey next to one in an Aston Villa scarf next to a group of young women dressed in animal print, in support of the Jaguars. Animosities are absent, the crowd cutting across all ages. The game does not seem as emotionally freighted as a result, but has the good-natured feel of a festival. The Jaguars lag for the first half, but there is a turning point and they romp to victory (32-16). I have been forewarned about NFL’s arcane rules but that is no obstruction to the drama. It is like losing a grip on the plot but being carried along by the spectacle. It doesn’t always have to be about conflict. As a music novice, I depart pretty awestruck Paul Weller at O2 City Hall Newcastle, 24 October, by football correspondent Louise Taylor In my peculiar little world, evening work assignments in north-east England at this time of year are synonymous with the need to keep warm, and I possess the duvet coats, thermals and glove collection to prove it. Indeed, resistance to winter weather is so central to the job that a useful piece of advice for anyone contemplating a career in football reporting is to sit outside on a cold night and type on a laptop for a couple of hours. So, for this interloper, it is a luxury to sit in a sold-out Newcastle City Hall and listen to an impressively eclectic two-hour Paul Weller set. A normal night match, 10 minutes’ walk away at Newcastle United’s St James’ Park, involves hitting a 10pm first-edition print deadline and requires roughly half my report to be emailed in at half-time, followed by a further chunk after 70 minutes. The introduction and payoff (the top and tail of the report) are sent at, or ideally slightly before, the final whistle. Next comes a post-match rewrite, including quotes from the managers, emphasising any news lines. Here, as a music novice, I am spared the need to file live and thus expose my ignorance of the nuances of woodwind, brass and baritone, and can simply enjoy a reminder of why I’ve always loved the Jam and the Style Council. I’m less familiar with Weller’s more recent stuff but depart pretty awestruck by the depth, breadth and sheer range of his repertoire. Long before the end, my appreciation of the knowledge, not to mention writing skill, of Guardian pop critics Alexis Petridis and co has been throughly amplified. A proper music writer’s review would presumably mention Weller’s declaration, made as he introduces the evocative Have You Ever Had It Blue, that the concert is dedicated to “the people of Gaza”. This is followed by the Modfather’s unequivocal description of events in that part of the Middle East as “a genocide” and “evil”. If a Premier League manager said something similar – or appeared, à la Weller, accompanied by a Palestinian flag – the sports pages would be ripped apart, and the energy invested in hammering out a story in pursuit of deadline would be enough to light up a small town. Armies of controversy-averse, brand-protecting “communication experts” strive to ensure football coaches avoid venturing into politics, but Weller’s views on Gaza – endorsed, incidentally, by widespread City Hall applause – are reiterated during most of his performances these days. The differences with football do not end there. As an anonymous face in the crowd, I feel free to clap enthusiastically as the audience dance in the stalls. At a match this would be considered deeply unprofessional, since sportswriters are expected to maintain strict impartiality at all times. Tonight, Weller belies his 66 years by performing Shout to the Top, That’s Entertainment, Town Called Malice et al with the boundless energy and verve of his 20th-century self. I don’t know much about football, but I’m totally gripped Brighton v Wolves at Amex stadium, Brighton, 26 October, by chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis I did not grow up in a big football family. My dad wasn’t around much, and he didn’t seem particularly interested in football anyway. My uncle was, to the extent that he even ended up working for his local team, but his local team was Panionios, in south Athens, and we lived in Yorkshire, so his enthusiasm wasn’t going to exert much influence on me. I dimly recall being taken to a Sunderland game by a relation, but the details of why and when are lost to me. I can remember seeing a really pissed bloke slumped on the pavement outside Roker Park, singing Lip Up Fatty by Bad Manners at the top of his voice, which I guess dates it to the early 80s, but that’s about it: it clearly didn’t make much of an impression. So I take my seat at the Amex stadium with a certain hangdog air. I’m sitting next to Guardian reporter John Brewin – who looks aghast when I tell him I don’t really know much about football and am expecting to be bored. But I’m really not, to a degree that startles me. I’m wary of stating the obvious here, but watching a game in person is a completely different experience from watching it on TV. I can somehow see what’s going on better. It brings a visceral clarity I’ve never experienced before: there’s something about witnessing first-hand the sheer speed of Brighton midfielder Kaoru Mitoma when he gets the ball, or the cool slickness of Danny Welbeck’s finish as he scores the first goal – he gives off the air of someone sticking a letter in a postbox – that I find completely involving. It helps that it is an exciting game. It’s supposedly a foregone conclusion. “The story is that Wolves are crap at the moment and Brighton have this wunderkind new manager, [Fabian] Hürzeler,” John tells me; even before the wunderkind rocked up, the last time they met, Brighton were 4-0 up within 55 minutes. But it doesn’t turn out like that at all. Initially, everything seems to be proceeding as expected. Brighton dominate the first half, culminating in Welbeck’s goal, although, with the benefit of hindsight, the number of chances they fail to put away before that should have indicated that things weren’t quite as cut and dried as assumed. Wolves are better in the second half – even I can tell they are playing with more attack after a couple of substitutions – although a goal by Evan Ferguson seems to seal the game. But you can’t fault Wolves’ tenacity: they just keep plugging away. Rayan Aït-Nouri scores almost immediately after Ferguson, then a disastrous pass by Mats Wieffer – at precisely the point it looks like Brighton are about to score a third – sends Wolves surging forward again in the 93rd minute, handing them an equaliser. Leaving the ground, I hear people talking about the frustrating lack of cohesion in Brighton’s playing, which they suggest is down to the absence of injured captain Lewis Dunk. I wouldn’t know. What I do know is that I’ve been completely gripped by something I’ve never been gripped by before. I couldn’t be more pleasantly surprised. Opera is absurd – and very long The Turn of the Screw, Coliseum, London, 29 October, by chief sports writer Barney Ronay We need an idiot. To be fair, the editorial steer on this assignment, sending a career sports hack to the opera, was a bit more nuanced than this. Just take it as it comes. Don’t feign expertise. Just be yourself. Describing physical performance is what we do all the time in sport. I have reported on thousands of live events over the last 20 years. I’ve seen Andrea Bocelli serenade Leicester City’s Premier League title celebrations, which was good and also didn’t last very long. I have looked on vaguely as an endless scroll of operatic singers belt out national anthems in echoey new-build stadiums. But I had never been to the opera, or wanted to. I can see the performers are hypertalented voice athletes, expressing through this highly formalised medium a genuinely wild emotional register, which isn’t too far off the kind of thing sport tries to do in its best moments. But the prospect of having to sit through what could be any number of hours (four? seven?) while people sing a story at each other has always seemed objectively painful to me. Sport reporting can often be a formulaic, zero-sum affair. As the crowd begins to filter into the Coliseum theatre’s lovely soft beige and brown interior, it is hard to avoid some familiar pre-performance thoughts. Who is going to win the opera? Should the ENO team try to get the crowd involved early on? There was talk pre-curtain of a novice conductor making her full debut here. Would Charlotte Corderoy do the basics well, settle in, and just look to find her feet at this level? There are two things worth saying straight away. Opera is, as expected, absurd on a very basic level. This not a bad thing. Lots of hard, interesting, endlessly refined cultural activities have this quality. Cricket is absurd. The 100m hurdles is absurd. Opera is at least instantly and unapologetically absurd. It turns out that the worst part of going to the opera is the opening second, when the curtain goes up and a man immediately starts singing his thoughts, at which point you realise this is just going to keep happening for a really, really long time. Everyone is going to sing all of their thoughts to everyone else all of the time. The German man who seemed to spend most of Euro 2024 outside Essen train station shouting every single one of his thoughts at passersby could walk on stage here and the audience would simply nod and say: “Hmm, interesting exposition.” The big thing about Benjamin Britten is that the libretto is in English, so you can at least understand the dialogue. This doesn’t necessarily help. Before long people are singing things like “You must be Mrs Grose” and “Who is at the door?” and “That’s my desk”. No shit. Happily, the necessary suspension of disbelief kicks in. There are thrilling and quite scary solos. The way the music drives the drama from one part to the next is absorbing. The visuals are great, in particular the projection of moving images on to a grimly portentous architectural set. There is still zero humour, not even “theatre humour” where people laugh in braying tones to show they understand Shakespeare’s puns. But this is probably for the best. Because the second thing worth saying is that this is a drama about child abuse. That was Britten’s interpretation of Henry James’s original novel, positioning this element right out in front as the key narrative peg. What you get is a show that graphically represents the grooming and sexual abuse of children and adults, while telling you in its tone and phrasing that this is simply a richly textured gothic horror. Britten’s opera focuses its gothic energy entirely on the physical and emotional abuse of Miles, a pre-pubescent boy, by the deceased paedophile valet, who also abused anyone else in his eyeline, and who is still present in ghost form grooming his charge. Basically this is Jimmy Savile with songs. The problem is these things are presented without nuance or depth. It’s all painfully prosaic. We literally watch a child being seduced by a paedophile, who strokes his face and looms in close over him. We see an onstage rape, which is, yep, definitely nasty. No doubt it would be possible to sound intelligent by saying this is all very difficult and challenging. But it lacks any really vivid signifiers as to what it’s wider meaning is supposed to be. To suggest, as James perhaps does too, that the entire drama might be taking place in the mind of an unstable female (Women! What are they like?!) isn’t complex or a brilliant literary device; it’s just exculpatory shittiness.By the end, it seems odd that this piece of art is still being performed at all, that we can’t simply have something new. Gen Z, if they ever get to the opera, aren’t going to put up with this. I would even advise people to avoid seeing it if they have come into contact with this kind of trauma in their own lives, as it has nothing to say that will make any kind of sense out of this. No doubt there are many who will disagree with the thrust of this review, will see it as bleating wokery, cancel culture. It isn’t really. You can generally separate the artist and the art. You could make the case that all we have here is a drama about the mystical power of children or some such. But it doesn’t feel like that. Sometimes, if something makes you feel creeped out, that’s just because it’s creepy. It reminded me of rummaging in my bag for my keys Saracens women v Gloucester-Hartpury, StoneX Stadium, London, 27 October, by dance critic Lyndsey Winship Broad daylight is not the natural milieu of a dance critic, but here we are pitch-side, taking notes on a fourth round premiership clash between Saracens Women and Gloucester-Hartpury. I’ve never watched a rugby match before, and to the outsider, this game, with its hookers and blindside flankers, sounds like some sort of quidditch. But what I saw was 80 minutes of brief dramas, flashes of grace and a frustrating amount of stop-start stasis. Coming from theatre, I found myself yearning for flow. Every few minutes the play stops, a ball goes out or a medic comes on, and there’s a blast of Kaiser Chiefs to fill the gap, or the announcer plugging an upcoming fireworks display. But sometimes you get this beautiful cascading momentum, bodies chasing the ball and chasing each other: a pass, a trip, a roll, a recovery, another run, in seamless motion – until interrupted by a storming tackle. As someone who deciphers bodies for a living, I enjoyed the intended, and unintended, choreography on the pitch. The set pieces, the line-outs especially – the adrenalised patter of quick-stepping feet, the surge as a jumper is lifted, soaring upward ramrod straight, stretching out arms and time (just for a millisecond) before being swallowed back into the team. But also the murmurations of the players, waves of Saracens’ black shirts like a tide ebbing westwards, as pink-clad Gloucester-Hartpury pushed them away from their goal, taking an early lead; the way the ball is like a mini black hole, sucking everything towards it, a tight cluster at the centre, but also a swirling galaxy of players moored to its gravity. The interlaced bodies of the scrum could be almost a constructivist choreography à la Bronislava Nijinska, or sometimes just a clumsy scramble of bums and thighs. Also, in the way you can’t really see what’s going on, it reminded me of exasperatedly rummaging in your bag for lost keys. The game’s fortunes shift constantly, like this sport’s seemingly ever-changing balance between collective strength and plucky individuals. Gloucester-Hartpury are 12 points up; the pendulum swings with a try from Saracens’ Bryony Field; Gabby Senft scores another; then Saracens lead by nine, but by half-time they’re 12 points down. In a stadium fit for 10,000, a crowd a 10th of that size for this women’s game feels sparse. You need the audience for drama to come alive. It’s not until there are 10 minutes to go and the home team is 35-38 down that survival instinct seems to kick in, on and off pitch, and the slider goes up on the supporters’ noise level. The game is like this – a lull of energy, a seeming stalemate, and then all of a sudden everything’s at stake, life or death. A runner breaks free: “Go hard! Go hard!” a teammate shouts. Last season’s champions Gloucester-Hartpury had not had two successive defeats this season until now. At the final gong, Saracens win 49-38, and I have found unexpected beauty amid the brute strength. A bit like when the home team wins a corner Dua Lipa at the Royal Albert Hall, London, 17 October, by sports writer Jonathan Liew This is actually the second time I’ve seen Dua Lipa. Six years ago, she was the pre-match entertainment at the Champions League final in Kyiv, and let’s just say that that is a gig that comes with challenges. Nobody is there to see you. The space is vast, the sound system largely designed for safety announcements. Lipa’s voice – sweet but fragile – died somewhere around the edge of the penalty area. Several of my colleagues didn’t even look up from their laptops. In a way, this has been a recurring motif of Lipa’s live career: a kind of roaming existence, constant away fixtures, the search for a constituency. Big stadiums seem to flatten her a bit. Glastonbury this summer didn’t quite work. How do you generate devotion when your whole shtick is a kind of arch detachment? What is your natural habitat when you’re a star of the pandemic? Which brings us to a warm and shimmering Albert Hall and this made-for-TV special. This is Dua as Serious Artist: one night only, a pitch for scarcity over volume, even a kind of anti-Eras vibe. Go girl, give us a 53-piece orchestra, every single track off Radical Optimism, your radically mid new album – no One Kiss, no New Rules. Give us a Gaultier dress and gloves that go up to your biceps. A serpentine walkway cuts a swoosh across the stage, somehow allowing her to walk towards you and away from you at the same time: classic Dua, beckoning you in with one hand and pushing you away with the other. The show sags about a quarter of the way in and again three-quarters in, and by absolutely no coincidence these are the most Radical Optimism-heavy parts. Some of the ornamentation works well – French Exit gets a nifty jazz-club reboot – but for all the bells and whistles, these are songs that really weren’t strong enough in the first place. The effect is somewhere between an extremely polished cruise ship performance and that bit in a football game when the home team wins a corner and everyone reluctantly stands up. Naturally, there is an insoluble problem here. Dua longs to contain multitudes, to be one of those rounded, versatile, shape-shifting modern pop stars capable of being all things to all people. You see it in her brand endorsements and her book club, her piecemeal forays into activism. But, ultimately, she has only ever really served one purpose: songs about dancing for people who really, really want to dance. And in this vocation, she remains unmatched by anyone on the planet. Houdini and Levitating at the start. Dance the Night and Don’t Start Now to finish, the climax of a breathtaking encore in which Elton John is winched on stage with all the audacity and flourish of Aston Villa throwing on Jhon Duran as an 85th-minute substitute. A piece of advice, from someone who once dreamed of writing generation-defining novels and now types jokes about football for the Guardian: there comes a point where you have to give up on being taken seriously. Sure, do the Albert Hall for the cachet. Add some strings to Houdini if you think it will impress people. But in the end, lean hard into the stuff people actually want. Which is songs about shit men and dancing so hard you stop crying. Because this stuff is going to be your ticket to immortality. Nail it and your natural habitat will be anywhere with a speaker, your natural constituency anybody with ears and toes to tap. I feel as if I’m on the Starship Enterprise England v Germany at Wembley Stadium, London, 25 October, by classical music critic Flora Willson “You know where you’re going, don’t you?” says the woman who hands over my press pass. I mumble apologetically. Does it count as impostor syndrome if you’re an actual impostor? They surely don’t get many Wembley first-timers at the media entrance. Or many classical music critics. But here I am, FA-accredited and clueless, for a women’s international friendly. I’ve already run the gamut of girls in tinsel-edged England cowboy hats, groups taking selfies, burger vans, merch stands, lines of stewards and police. Loudspeakers bark instructions like a PE teacher turned dictator. Vast screens pulse constantly. Compared with most classical music venues, Wembley feels like the Starship Enterprise. Inside, the media suite is already full of people typing frantically. After years of indecipherable scribbling in darkened auditoriums, I hadn’t considered bringing my laptop. But it’s obviously not the main thing I lack. “Do you know what formation they play?” one journalist asks his colleague. “I’d probably go 4-2-1-3,” she replies. I try not to panic. I don’t know which team they mean. I couldn’t distinguish 4-2-1-3 from any other formation. And no, I can’t explain the offside rule. I head outside in search of atmosphere – more familiar territory – and find an array of industrial sprinklers watering the pitch. Nothing much happens. But suddenly the lights go down, thousands of phone lights twinkle and there are fireworks, pounding drum’n’bass and roaring from the crowd as an enormous England crest is unfurled. Then a fidgety hush. After that, the match starts abruptly. I miss it while trying to spot the brass band I can hear. Idiot music critic, I hear you cry! But missing the vital stuff is horribly easy. Everything happens at astonishing speed, players moving in clusters of whirling legs and breakneck turns, numbers on shirts barely legible. My respect for sports journalists – writing as they watch the melee, filing as the whistle blows – reaches a new high. I catch Germany scoring their first goal two minutes in but don’t see what earned a Lioness a yellow card soon after. An England goal generates a deafening response but is disallowed for reasons I can’t fathom. By half-time, the score is 3-2 to Germany. “This is insane,” mutters one of the real reporters. In the second half, things slow down. A squadron of paper planes floats past, thrown by bored kids in the upper stands. A guy nearby works his way through a massive cup of jellybeans. There are substitutions, near-misses, occasional goals. At one point Germany’s coach waves his arms furiously from the sidelines. As far as I can tell, no one takes any notice. The big screen informs us there are 47,967 people there – just over 50% capacity. Some are already leaving. And then it’s over: 4-3 to Germany. Downstairs, a sad-looking man in a cardigan presides silently over the press conference room. “We had too many unforced errors,” concedes the Lionesses’ coach, Sarina Wiegman. By the time I emerge, the crowd has gone. The stadium rings with the low buzz of six lawnmowers, its hallowed pitch now just so much grass. A dark tale – so dark, it’s hard to take notes Lizzie the Musical at Hope Mill Theatre, Manchester, ends 17 November, by sports writer Tanya Aldred As a cricket reporter, going to work without having to wear an anorak is a good start. The unfamiliarity of this new experience continues in the warmth of Hope Mill’s snug bar, decorated with fairy lights, rugs, chandeliers and old red velvet theatre seats with just the right amount of sag. Those gathered for a pre-show drink are definitely more female than your average County Championship crowd – though, as at the cricket, a handful sit comfortably alone with only a (very nice) coffee for company. We’re all here for Lizzie the Musical, based on the true story of Lizzie Borden, who was tried for – and acquitted of – the murder of her father and stepmother in 1892. The Massachusetts public – in fact, the wider US – couldn’t get enough of the scandal. It ticked every titillating box that a burgeoning mass media could blow out: a bloody axe; respectable, if repellent victims; a society spinster suspect; a burnt dress. Fascination with the story has been long-lasting. This show premiered in New York in 2009, and is back in Manchester after a sellout run at Hope Mill last summer. A four-woman cast, fuelled by an electric all-woman band, belt through the murderous buildup and the subsequent court case, with a succession of furious tunes. All four leads hold the stage with gumption, even during the less catchy numbers: the beguiling Katie Tonkinson as meek neighbour Alice, hopelessly in love with Lizzie; Emilie Louise Israel as sharp older sister Emma; and Kayleigh McKnight in the title role, seamlessly switching from heavy sorrow to righteous fury. But the standout turn is Eve Kitchingman as Bridget, the Borden family maid. Performing the part for the first time, as a stand-in for Jennifer Caldwell, she lets emotions peel across her face, a roll of the eye here, a purse of the lips there – the all-knowing observer of the piece. The seats rise rustically, and steeply, from almost the lip of the stage, in the manner of Old Trafford’s party stand. The intimacy of the venue works particularly well for such a visceral production (though I haven’t worked out how to take notes in the dark). This is complemented by a simple set that makes the most of the industrial beams latticing the ceiling, filling them with doves who will meet a nasty end, while projections are beamed on to the screen. The choreography is thoughtful – I love the scene set around the coffee pot – and the long skirts and low-slung belts are worn with riot grrrl attitude. Watching a musical about a double murder – even if the grisly bits happen offstage – and listening to lyrics about incest (the desperately sad This Is Not Love) raises more complex emotions than is usual on day two of Derbyshire v Glamorgan. But the high-energy finale matches the glory of a tight last-over finish, only with no statistics to comb through afterwards and no danger of rain stopping play."

        "Titre": "Bath go deep to surge back and overcome Gloucester in derby cracker",
        "Auteur": "Robert Kitson at Kingsholm",
        "Date": "2024-10-12",
        "Texte": "Another week, another rip-roaring West Country derby. This time, though, it was an increasingly rampant Bath who headed home with the bragging rights after recovering from an 11-point deficit to collect an eight-try victory and their highest points tally against their neighbours in the fabled history of this fixture. In addition to two close-range tries for prop Beno Obano, Bath’s success was based on their better decision-making, breakdown superiority and surer execution under pressure. Ted Hill and Ollie Lawrence were outstanding and there was a visible desire to atone for the disappointing home loss to Bristol at the Rec last Saturday. Six second-half tries also further underlined the quality of their bench resources. It was harsh on a few Cherry and White individuals. Ollie Thorley on the right wing was like a man possessed, Zach Mercer and Josh Hathaway had their eye-catching moments and the young England Under-20 prop Afolabi Fasogbon once again looked a significant talent in the making. In the final analysis, though, Gloucester could not sustain the best of themselves for 80 minutes and their lineout and defence clearly remain works in progress. The home director of rugby, George Skivington, still wants his team to stay true to their attacking instincts but accepted that six squandered lineouts and a costly tendency to overplay at times had undone much of their good work. “Bath scored at least four tries from us making a wrong decision in attack and being reckless rather than organised,” said Skivington, whose side lost the second half 38-7. “We know that’s the risk of playing the way we’re playing but I think we can be better on both sides of the ball.” At least it all made for a slightly more encouraging spectacle for the longsuffering Shed faithful. Feisty, loud, eventful: for the first 40 minutes a raucous home crowd were gleefully lapping it all up. Gloucester endured a lean season last year and the collective release of pent-up local joy was mighty as their team began like Cheltenham Gold Cup pacesetters. Bath did score first via a well-worked try by Obano after a smart tap penalty move but the hosts swiftly responded with three excellent tries of their own within 16 minutes. The centre Max Llewellyn scored the first after smart some interplay with the rapid Hathaway and Tomos Williams nipped over for a second after 20 minutes. The best was yet to come, though, with Mercer surging clear and finding Williams who put the replacement Charlie Atkinson over for a smashing try. With Arthur Clark injured in the warm-up and Freddie Thomas and Gareth Anscombe not making it beyond the first 22 minutes, though, Gloucester needed to stay focused tactically. It was unhelpful, then, when hooker Jack Singleton attempted a hopeful chip ahead five metres from his own line to gave Bath a great attacking platform which ended with Finn Russell twisting over. The visitors were also being kept in it by Hill, repackaged as a lock for the afternoon. The former Worcester captain was brilliant in the air in open field and a menace at the lineout, reducing the amount of ball available to Gloucester’s hungry backs. There was still scope, even so, for the powerful Thorley to remind everyone of his ability and the captain, Lewis Ludlow, ensured the Glaws line held firm when another Bath score seemed inevitable. At the other end there was almost a second score for Williams but, after a thrilling chase, Hathaway was adjudged to have dived on top of the scrambling Austin Emens, the debutant visiting wing who has previously impressing for the University of Bath and GB sevens. After the interval, though, it was increasingly one-sided. The hard-to-stop Obano crashed over from short range just four minutes after the restart to level the scores at 24-24 and when Atkinson stopped a sniping Ben Spencer from an offside position close to the line the outcome was a penalty try and a yellow card. Bath were swift to exploit their numerical advantage, working the hard-working Josh Bayliss over before a turnover on the Gloucester 22 allowed Tom de Glanville to race 80m to score at the other end. The determined Thorley claimed himself a deserved try to secure a try bonus point, with George Barton coolly drop-kicking the conversion after the ball had topped from the tee, but the irresistible Lawrence and Jaco Coetzee added further late tries to propel the visitors past the half-century."

Standing for re-election is a British lawyer, Michael Lodge, but the UK government should support his Brazilian challenger, because the incumbent has been excessively supportive of mining corporations wanting to expand deep-sea mining. Despite marine scientists warning of horrifying ecological damage, he said: “I don’t believe people should worry that much.” In the eight years of his leadership, the ISA has acted more as a mining developer than as the steward of the blue commons that it was set up to be. Under his leadership, the ISA has sold 31 so-called exploratory licences for mining in an area of about 1.5m sq km of seabed, gaining $500,000 for each licence for the ISA, each coming to about 7% of the ISA’s budget in each year they were granted. Under his leadership, the ISA was supposed to draw up a mining code that protects the environment, and a mechanism for sharing the benefits among its 168 member countries. It has failed to do either. The ISA is a vital part of global governance. It needs to be strengthened and properly led.

        "Titre": "Court clears man with severe learning difficulties of 1990 London murder",
        "Auteur": "Daniel Boffey Chief reporter",
        "Date": "2024-09-11",
        "Texte": "Oliver Campbell, a man with severe learning difficulties who was jailed for life for the murder of a shopkeeper three decades ago after confessing in police interviews, has had his convictions quashed by the court of appeal. The judgment clearing Campbell, 54, of conspiracy to rob and murder ends what has been described as one of the longest miscarriages of justice in British criminal history, and will throw a new focus on past policing failures and the current approach of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). Campbell said: “The fight for justice is finally over after nearly 34 years. I can start my life an innocent man.” Campbell, who suffered a severe brain injury as a baby, was convicted at the age of 21 at the Old Bailey in 1991 of the murder of a London off-licence keeper, Baldev Hoondle, after confessing during the 11th of 14 police interviews, some of which were carried out without a solicitor. The court of appeal heard from expert witnesses that Campbell had an IQ of 73 and scored “abnormally high” for acquiescence, with an “extreme tendency to just, when in doubt, say yes”. His barrister, Michael Birnbaum KC, told the court police had “badgered and bullied” him into giving a false confession. Although the judges said they had not seen evidence of police bullying, an expert witness who gave evidence at the original trial concluded upon reviewing the case that he had not properly understood Campbell’s vulnerabilities at the time of the trial or appeal. Other evidence linking Campbell to the murder had been his recently bought British Knights baseball cap, said by a witness to have been worn by the gunman and found near the scene of the crime, and a friendship with Eric Samuels, a then 26-year-old man who admitted being part of a robbery of the off-licence on Lower Clapton Road in Hackney, east London, at 10.30pm on 22 July 1990. But Samuels, who was subsequently jailed for five years for robbery but not murder, named a different man, known only as Harvey, as his accomplice in a statement to police. Campbell had bought a British Knights cap eight days before the murder but had given it away soon after, according to a witness, and there were hair samples in the cap that did not belong to Campbell or Samuels. The gunman was also said to be right-handed, while Campbell is left-handed. Hoondle’s son, Hardip, was in the off-licence when his father was shot in the head, and gave a description of the gunman, who he said had been wearing a British Knights cap. He did not pick out Campbell in an identity parade, and a second witness outside the shop gave an estimate of the height of the wearer of the cap as several inches shorter than Campbell’s 1.90m (6ft 3in). Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Bourne and Mrs Justice Stacey, ruled that statements from Samuels, who has since died, which exonerated Campbell were now admissible as evidence, but that the greatest weight in their judgment was given to the risk that the confessions to police had been false. Holroyde wrote that many of the points the defence team made had already been made in the original trial, and that the alleged absurdity of the confessions were “equally inaccurate or absurd at the time of the trial”. But he added: “The principal reason for our disquiet arises from the fact that the fresh evidence would provide a court with the benefit of much more information than was available at the trial about the appellant’s mental state when he made his confessions. “As a result of the fresh expert evidence, the whole approach to the case would now be informed by a different and better understanding of relevant factors. “Even if all the evidence of confessions were admitted, a jury knowing of the fresh evidence would be considering the reliability of those confessions in a materially different context. In those circumstances, we cannot say that the fresh evidence could not reasonably have affected the decision of the jury to convict. “On that narrow but very important basis, we have concluded that the convictions are unsafe.” Glyn Maddocks KC, who has represented Campbell for more than two decades, broke the news to his client of the court of appeal’s decision at 10.30am on Wednesday as the judgment was published. “There was a lot of whooping and excitement from all his supporters around him, yeah,” he said. “So he was absolutely thrilled. It’s been a hell of a journey for him. He’s kept me going, in a way, through the quiet periods.” Campbell spent 11 years in prison before being released on licence in 2002. The CCRC previously reviewed his case after an application in 1999 but made a decision not to refer it to the court of appeal in 2005. The CCRC finally referred the case to the court of appeal in November 2022 on the grounds of “modern standards of fairness” and a change in expert opinion. Maddocks said there had not been much difference between the 1999 admission to the CCRC and the latest effort, but that he believed a speech in the House of Commons by the then Labour MP Sandy Martin in 2019 calling for a fresh review had unlocked the case. “I think one of the reasons they turned it down [in 2005] was that they went to Eric Samuels at that time. They got him separately represented,” Maddocks said. “But he was too worried about being prosecuted again in the early 2000s and no one gave him an immunity. “I think they talked about it, but they could have gone to the CPS and said, you know, the CPS will give you an immunity against prosecution. I think they were sort of slightly half-hearted about it, but that was one of the reasons they decided not to turn it down. Because he was uncooperative. “I’m not criticising them, to be honest. I think they’ve done a good job on this one. They’ve had enough criticisms, generally, haven’t they? So, you know, give them a bit of credit.” The judges rejected the crown’s argument that there should be a retrial on the grounds that Campbell’s mental capacity had worsened over the years and he could not be fairly tried. The Met said it would review the full judgment of the court. A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The court of appeal rejected 17 grounds of appeal and these convictions were only quashed on the basis of new evidence providing more information about Oliver Campbell’s mental state when he confessed to murder. We respect the judgment of the court.” Speaking to the Guardian before his appeal hearing, Campbell admitted that life for him would probably always have been hard but that he wished he had been given a chance to make it better. “I could have had a full-time job, kids, married, had a relationship, maybe going on holiday,” he said. “Now I am like in a room and all the doors are locked.”"

        "Auteur": "Lisa Wright",
        "Date": "2024-11-15",
        "Texte": "Less an album, more an aural family scrapbook, Smoky Mountain DNA attempts to catalogue five generations of the Owens-Parton clan via a hefty 37-track collection of mostly duets between Dolly and her extended family on both sides, past and present. Combining archival, overdubs and new recordings, it takes us on a lengthy journey that begins in 1964 with Parton’s fiddle-playing grandfather, the Rev Jake Owens, on I Live in Glory, and ends with a Disney-lite ballad, Randy Floyd, written and sung by Parton and her teenage great-niece Merin Seaver. At first it’s impossible not to be charmed, as our celebrated tour guide – one of 12 siblings – kicks things off with a spoken-word invitation. But as with any family, and certainly any record of this size, there is a vast spectrum of appeal. Parton’s 1970s duet with her aunt Dorothy Jo Owens on the latter’s Runaway Girl, or the newly gospel-backed Singing His Praise/ Daddy Was an Old Time Preacher Man medley, sung in 2011 alongside her uncles Bill and Louis Owens, offer a window into the musical heritage that made the star. However, by the time we reach today’s series of young hopefuls and vaguely musical cousins, it all just feels like an exercise in well-meaning nepotism."

        "Auteur": "Laura Snapes",
        "Date": "2024-09-30",
        "Texte": "Every time I get in my car and plug my phone in, an interstitial from Rosalía’s 2022 album Motomami starts playing. “A de alfa, altura, alien,” she recites on Abcdefg. “B de bandida, C de coqueta” – I can’t turn it off fast enough. I love Rosalía but the Apple Music app defaults to the first song in the alphabet in my catalogue whenever it’s connected to the car, and Abcdefg is it. Her cute little ABC drives me nuts. Obviously it doesn’t take long to switch to something else – the MP3s I still transfer on to my phone, like the inveterate iPod user I was, or pretty much all the music in the world ever on Spotify or the apps of NTS or Bandcamp. Rosalía sometimes appears further down the alphabet, though, when I sit in the driver’s seat – categorically the best place to listen to music alone – struggling to think of what to put on amid the endless possibilities. No music fan is going to lament a state of affairs in which technology means that you could feasibly drive while listening to a radio station broadcasting from Antarctica rather than suffering through the ads on your local commercial FM. But the tyranny of choice (not to mention the lure of nostalgia) can make the comparatively limited days of the in-car CD player, or multi-disc changer, if you were fancy, seem highly attractive. Hold on to them if you’ve got them: from now on, car manufacturers in the UK will no longer include CD players on new models. The final outlier, the Subaru Forester, has been revamped without one. Instead, new car stereos will be geared towards streaming, making the staple of the last 40 years of in-car entertainment obsolete. Some have questioned the move as CD sales were up 3.2% in the first half of 2024. Kim Bayley, the CEO of digital entertainment and retail association ERA, said: “With 15% of the UK adult population reporting that they listen to CDs in their cars, this is a remarkably shortsighted move by carmakers to stop fans listening to the music they love.” But you can’t really argue with the inevitable march of history, nor justify making extra versions of cars just to serve a small minority. You could argue that in-car CD players have an appealing simplicity compared to the pitfalls of connecting phones through unreliable Bluetooth/USB interfaces (Spotify is ceasing operations of its poorly reviewed “Car Thing” in December), though the footwells filled with cracked and splintered jewel cases tell the truer story about convenience. The only real case for what is soon to be lost, I think, is that of a limited selection of music in the car forcing you to spend time with it, forging deep and often weird attachments – sometimes to entirely unexpected records – in the process. (Just this week, I walked past a parked car that had the same old red inflatable CD holder on the dashboard as I used to have and I felt a furious pang for the 12 painstakingly selected albums mine used to contain.) As I wrote when Oasis reunited, the CD changer in Dad’s car (Mum’s only had a cassette deck) was a portal to childhood music discovery. Aged six, I knew nothing of Britpop or even Liam or Noel; I just knew the pure pleasures of (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? and how the sloshing intro to Champagne Supernova was a great way to taunt my little brother when he needed a wee. That album was the soundtrack to the first year I started at a new school. Dad always drove me in: I can still remember the profound embarrassment when he suddenly turned the volume down while I was singing along to try to trick me into continuing unaccompanied. Before long, I had my own designs on the CD player and would force the Spice Girls in among Enya (we in the backseat hated Enya) and the Beautiful South, which I didn’t like but it at least seemed excitingly grownup. It had a “parental advisory: explicit content” sticker (ie contained swearing) and whatever “this could be Rotterdam or anywhere / Liverpool orange” – orange pronounced the French way, as I heard it as a kid – might mean, it sounded terribly sophisticated. After a Christmas trip to Disneyland Paris, Dad would blast the awful Disney-penned Christmas carol Chante, C’est Noël at the height of summer to make the now three-strong denizens of the back seat squeal for mercy. At the same time as car CD players became commonplace in the 90s, British supermarkets were giving over significant square footage to entertainment sections during the CD boom. Their parallel rise gave way to a new era of signings that the whole family could listen to in the car without risk – no saucy “Liverpool orange” here. The so-called Mondeo Man, an aphorism purloined from Tony Blair, supposedly pushed Britpop towards more middle-of-the-road territory; come the early 00s, a certain kind of consumer put debut albums by the likes of Joss Stone, Jamie Cullum and Michael Bublé in the trolley alongside the latest bits for a Jamie Oliver recipe. The prevalence of young millennials at recent gigs by James Blunt, Keane and Texas suggests the long-tail effects of this in-car exposure. A certain stripe of music fan would find this entirely lamentable, a moment paving the way for the rise of the “new boring”. But if there is fondness to be had here, it’s for one of the last communal family listening experiences, even if it only gave you something to chafe against, jamming on your headphones in the back seat to listen to the very anarchist and entirely non-corporate sounds of, for example, Avril Lavigne on your MiniDisc player instead. The last time I regularly drove a car with a CD player, the door pocket selections were Pet Shop Boys’ Super, Paramore’s After Laughter and Calvin Harris’s Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1, giving me an enduring fondness for each one. I wouldn’t trade my current setup – on my last long drive, I toggled between Alan Sparhawk, MJ Lenderman and Amyl and the Sniffers at the flick of a finger while at traffic lights – but those soundtrack limitations fostered a weird and lasting personal canon. Save Oasis, my formative car classics aren’t records you will find on a list of 1,000 albums you must hear before you die, but a wonky, rudimental sort of musical ABC and family history that I cherish."

        "Titre": "Lopsided playing field: executives with deep pockets spend big on Oakland recall races",
        "Auteur": "Ali Winston",
        "Date": "2024-10-29",
        "Texte": "Oakland is in the midst of one of its most contentious, and one of its most expensive, election cycles. Campaign finance records show that in the past 10 months, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent on the effort to recall Sheng Thao, the embattled mayor of the northern California city. Tens of thousands of dollars have gone into city council races, and to the effort to recall the local district attorney, Pamela Price. Many of these donations came from just a handful of people: wealthy figures in real estate, finance and tech, some of whom have long funded political battles against progressives in nearby San Francisco. And just like in San Francisco, many of the donations have been organized through a complicated web of non-profits and political action committees, a “gray-money” structure that helps obscure who is behind the contributions. The efforts are tapping the real and deep frustrations of Oakland residents – a pandemic-era spike in violence and property crime that has only recently started declining, a looming budget crisis amid the growth of remote work and emigration, the departure of famed sports teams and an FBI raid on the mayor’s house as part of a corruption investigation. But the donations have made for a lopsided playing field. To date, Thao and her supporters have raised about $117,000 to fight the recall, according to campaign finance documents. Her opponents hold a significant lead. The recall’s official coordinating committee, Oakland United to Recall Sheng Thao (Oust), raised at least $600,000 in 2024. The process of gathering enough signatures to qualify the recall petition for this fall’s ballot alone cost the campaign $350,000, according to records filed by Oust. Ron Conway, a San Francisco investor who has long been a major donor in San Francisco politics, gave at least $15,000 to the committee organizing the mayor’s recall, according to campaign finance records. But at least 80% of all campaign contributions to the effort came from one man: Philip Dreyfuss, a partner at the Farallon Capital hedge fund and a resident of the wealthy nearby city of Piedmont. Dreyfuss’ central role in backing the recalls was first reported by local news outlet the Oaklandside. Dreyfuss is no stranger to political contributions. He was a major donor to the successful 2022 recall campaign against the San Francisco district attorney Chesa Boudin, and has donated more than $600,000 to this year’s effort to recall Price. Dreyfuss did not respond to questions from the Guardian about his donations, nor has he responded to questions from other outlets. At a press conference earlier this month, Thao pointed at Farallon Capital’s coal interests as a possible motivation behind Dreyfuss’ support of the recall, and the many lawsuits over the construction of a coal export terminal at the Oakland port. But it’s unclear to what extent Dreyfuss is involved in the fund’s coal investments. The reports that one wealthy figure is behind such a large share of donations has raised concerns in the region, including from prominent political figures like US congresswoman Barbara Lee, who has called the effort to recall the mayor “undemocratic, costly and chaotic”. “The voters – through regular elections, not a few billionaires – are the ones with the power to ensure our democratic process remains strong and in place,” Lee has said. An overlapping network of organizations Dreyfuss has been the largest donor in the election cycle, but he’s not the only one. Over the summer, Jesse Pollak, a cryptocurrency investor and executive at Coinbase, launched Abundant Oakland, an advocacy organization that funds “moderate” candidates running in Oakland races. The organization is explicitly linked to similarly named entities in San Francisco and Santa Monica. Abundant Oakland has a related political action committee, Vibrant Oakland, which, campaign filings show, has received donations from Pollak ($115,000), the Oakland police officers association ($50,000), cryptocurrency executive Konstantin Richter ($60,000), the northern California carpenters regional council ($150,000) and a Pac controlled by Piedmont landlord Chris Moore ($100,000). Through Vibrant Oakland, Abundant Oakland has put $100,000 via independent expenditure committees towards the campaign of Warren Logan, who is bidding to oust progressive Carroll Fife for the council seat representing downtown and west Oakland, where Pollak and his wife lived before relocating to neighboring Berkeley. Campaign finance records show Pollak has also poured at least $50,000 into another organization, Empower Oakland. That ‘voter education’ organization was created last year by Thao’s main opponent in the 2022 mayor’s race, the city councilman, Loren Taylor. Founding personnel from Abundant Oakland sit on the organization’s endorsement committee. Other donors to the organization, campaign finance records show, are personal finance executive Ryan Graciano ($50,000) and tech entrepreneur Gagan Biyani ($50,000). Empower Oakland is rallying for both Thao and Price to be recalled. The list of candidates the group has endorsed is a who’s who of the mayor’s critics: Brenda Harbin-Forte, a former Oakland police commissioner and the current chair of the Thao recall committee, who’s running for city attorney; and LeRonne Armstrong, who was fired by Thao in 2023 as Oakland police chief for for failing to discipline a politically connected sergeant and publicly attacking the mayor. He’s running for the at-large city council seat. As of early October, Harbin-Forte’s campaign had received more than $149,000 worth of support from Vibrant Oakland in the form of advertising and campaign literature. A different Pac that is paying for Harbin-Forte’s campaign advertisements received $24,000 from two executives at a company seeking to develop the controversial coal shipping terminal, the Oaklandside reported. Responding to questions from the Guardian, Pollak referred to a recent interview with the Oaklandside in which he said he decided to set up Abundant Oakland and Vibrant Oakland because he realized that “our current approach as a city isn’t working” during his years as a west Oakland resident, and that his decision to move to Berkeley was driven by pandemic-era concerns about violence and public safety. “When you look at the outcomes that have been driven in the city over the last three to four years, we’re not heading in the right direction,” Pollak said. Real impact of monied campaigns Dreyfuss’ contributions to the Thao recall were revealed over the summer, in the campaign finance disclosures of the recall’s official committee (Oust) and a Pac called Foundational Oakland Unites. The July disclosures show Dreyfuss had donated nearly $600,000 to the Pac by June, and was its only donor. OUST separately reported receiving $480,000 from the Pac. The interlocking nature of Oust and FOU is under investigation by the city’s public ethics commission, which is seeking records from Oust to determine whether the financial maneuvers were carried out with the intent of concealing the source of donations to the recall campaign. Simon Russell, the watchdog’s chief of enforcement at the time, said in the lawsuit that public records available to his team show “a pattern which suggests that OUST solicited contributions to itself via Foundational Oakland Unites, and that Foundational Oakland Unites raised money with the purpose of contributing it to OUST”, the recall’s fundraising committee. Financial disclosures show that Oust spent $6,000 this summer fighting the lawsuit. Russell resigned in September, lamenting what he sees as the persistent underfunding of his office. His recent casework had an outsized impact on Oakland politics. One investigation led to a $21,000 fine for Thao’s predecessor Libby Schaaf for violating campaign finance laws. Another uncovered a straw-donor campaign by one of the city’s waste haulers that is now at the heart of an FBI investigation into municipal corruption. Meanwhile, the sheer amount of money being spent to push the messaging of the campaign to recall Thao – much of which centers around public safety – is having a real impact on the East Bay’s political culture, said George Bisharat, a former public defender and professor emeritus of law at UC San Francisco. “There are some real shifts going on now in Oakland, and we won’t know until we have the results of the recall how significant they are,” Bisharat said. “But I think Sheng Thao is in a lot of trouble.” • This story was edited on 28 October 2024. An earlier version said that Empower Oakland had received $150,000 from both Ryan Graciano and Gagan Biyani when it should have said they had each given $50,000. It was further amended on 30 October 2024. The earlier version had said Jesse Pollak had given at least $125,000 which had been amended to $115,000, but this should have said $50,000."

        "Texte": "Late-night hosts discussed Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, sending him back to the White House. Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert didn’t mince words on the results of the 2024 election: “Well, fuck. It happened, again,” he said. “After a bizarre and vicious campaign fueled by a desperate need not to go to jail, Donald Trump has won the 2024 election. “The deep shock and sense of loss is enormous,” he continued. “But let’s look at the bright side. This way at least there’ll be a peaceful transfer of power. Mike Pence, olly olly oxen free. All day yesterday, I was walking around proudly wearing my ‘I Voted’ sticker. Today I wore my, ‘I am questioning my fundamental belief in the goodness of humanity’ sticker. “Now as a late-night host, people often say to me, ‘Come on, part of you has gotta want Trump to win because he gives you so much material to work with,’” he added. “No. No one tells the guy who cleans the bathroom, ‘Wow, you must love it when someone has explosive diarrhea, there’s so much material for you to work with!’ “I wish, you wish, so many of us wish this hadn’t happened,” he continued, “but that is not for any of us to decide. This is a democracy. That’s Democracy with a capital ‘duh’. And in this democracy, the majority has spoken, and they said they don’t actually care that much about democracy.” The Late Show host congratulated Harris and Tim Walz on running an “extraordinary” 107-day campaign, and looked to the bleak future. “The first time Donald Trump was elected, he started as a joke and ended as a tragedy. This time he starts as a tragedy. Who knows what he’ll end as – a limerick? “Who knows what the next four years are going to be like,” he added. “What we do know is that we are going to be governed by a monstrous child surrounded by cowards and grifters, and my brain keeps pumping out an unlimited supply of ramifications. It’s really hard to see a bright side here.” But “we can take comfort in knowing that we’ve been here before. We know what’s coming,” he concluded. And there would be jokes, “because that’s what we do. And I’ll let you in on a little secret. No one gets into this business because everything in their life worked out great, so were built for rough roads. You guys ready?” Jimmy Kimmel “Let me tell you, that was the worst Taco Tuesday of my whole life,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday evening. “We had the choice between a prosecutor and a criminal and we chose the criminal to be president of the United States. More than half of this country voted for the criminal who’s planning to pardon himself for his crimes. I guess this election wasn’t rigged.” Fighting back tears, Kimmel listed everyone that Trump’s election will hurt: “It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hard-working immigrants who make this country go, for healthcare, for our climate, for scientists, for journalists, for justice, for free speech. It was a terrible night for poor people, for the middle class, for seniors who rely on social security, for our allies in Ukraine, for Nato and democracy and decency. It was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him and guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him, too. You just don’t realize it yet.” It was a good night, however, for Putin, polio and “lovable billionaires like Elon Musk and the bros up in Silicon Valley and all the wriggling brain worms who sold what was left of their souls to bow down to Donald Trump”. “But I’m gonna say something that Trump would never say unless it favored him,” he added. “The people voted and this is the choice we made. In January, Donald Trump becomes president and that’s that, he won. It doesn’t mean we give up, but it also doesn’t mean we storm the Capitol because we don’t like the result.” Despite a lot of people not wanting to hear any silver lining, Kimmel endeavored to end on a positive note. “The best I can come up with is, we’ve been through this once before and yes, this time it is probably going to be worse, maybe a lot worse, but I also think that maybe we will look back and realize that in the long run, this is what we needed to wake us up,” he concluded. “Maybe the people who care so much about him need to find out how little he cares about them.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also mourned Trump’s victory, noting that he will be the oldest person to ever take office and the first convicted felon. “When I was in grade school, they always told us anyone could grow up to be president, but they didn’t say ‘literally fucking anyone’,” he joked. “I wish I had some trenchant words of wisdom to impart,” he later added. “I’m sad to say I don’t. We’re about to step over the precipice into truly uncharted territory. You need only look back to Trump’s first term to get a sense of how dangerous his second term will be. And no one can say they didn’t know what they were getting, because Trump made it crystal clear. All I know is that the fight for justice doesn’t end with one election. “In times like this, when everything feels overwhelming and impossible, like all hope is lost, we have no choice but to look back on the broad scope of history,” he continued. “Justice is not automatic, comeuppance is not guaranteed, politics unfortunately is not a Marvel movie, even though Joe Biden does look eerily like old Captain America. That doesn’t mean a struggle toward a more just and compassionate world is futile, it just means it’s hard, and heartbreaking and soul-crushing and agonizing. And it never ends. Democracy does not happen only on election day.” Meyers ended with an exhortation to his viewers to keep fighting back: “If you’re one of the tens of millions of Americans who said no to Trump’s dark, dangerous vision for America last night, now is the time to stand in solidarity with our friends, with our neighbors, with the vulnerable communities, and begin the hard work of making real the world we want to live in. That’s what we will be doing on day one.”"

        "Titre": "A Different Man review – beauty is skin deep in a surreal dramedy",
        "Auteur": "Wendy Ide",
        "Date": "2024-10-05",
        "Texte": "Some films strive to take us under the skin of a character. And then there’s Aaron Schimberg’s mordant oddity, A Different Man, a picture that peels back chunks of livid flesh to explore the overstuffed psychological baggage of Edward (Sebastian Stan, encased in prosthetics). An aspiring actor with severe facial disfigurement, Edward volunteers for an experimental treatment that “cures” his condition. He severs ties with his old identity, starting a new life as Guy (Stan minus the prosthetics), a hotshot estate agent. But physical beauty is not always the happy ending that we assume it will be. Guy becomes obsessed with Oswald (British actor and TV presenter Adam Pearson), who he views as a happier, more successful version of his former self. Pearson previously starred in Schimberg’s 2019 film Chained for Life, about an actress struggling to connect with a disfigured co-star; Schimberg, who has a cleft palate, is drawn to the theme of facial differences. To add another uneasy meta layer to this Kaufmanesque dramedy, Oswald has been cast in the lead role of a play titled Edward, written by Guy’s former neighbour Ingrid (Renate Reinsve) and based on him. There are a lot of ideas churning around in this intriguing but scattershot picture, which veers into the surreal and macabre in its quest to explore themes of identity, authenticity and the nature of beauty. Not all of it lands successfully, particularly in the increasingly agitated and fragmented second half. Still, Stan (who also impresses as Donald Trump in the forthcoming The Apprentice) is excellent as a man who, whatever his outward appearance, is chronically uncomfortable in his own skin. • In UK and Irish cinemas now and Australian cinemas on 24 October."

        "Titre": "John Oliver on deep-sea mining: ‘Time that we stop treating the deep ocean as something to exploit’",
        "Auteur": "Adrian Horton",
        "Date": "2024-06-10",
        "Texte": "John Oliver dove into the controversial topic of deep-sea mining on Last Week Tonight, particularly in the environment known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a Europe-sized area 3 miles beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii. There is virtually no light in the CCZ and water temperatures in the CCZ can reach zero degrees celsius, “and yet, for such a seemingly inhospitable place, there is still an incredible amount of life down there”, said Oliver. Scientists estimate that the CCZ contains over 8,000 largely unidentified species of fantastical deep-sea creatures, including a fluorescent sea cucumber dubbed a “gummy squirrel”, which Oliver delighted in. “Oh, I like that a lot,” he enthused. “In fact, I love that gummy squirrel so much, I want to cover it in sour dust and eat a bag of them while watching Nicole Kidman talk about the magic of the movies.” The CCZ also contains small solid nodules containing precious metals such as cobalt and nickel, accumulated over millions of years. Given their contents, companies are fighting to obtain what some call a “battery in a rock”, for their potential use in electric cars. Chief among them is Gerard Barron, the Australian founder and CEO of The Metals Company, who is pursuing what Oliver called “commercial-scale plunder” of the CCZ. Barron prefers to describe the process of mining these nodules as simply picking up golf balls, as on a driving range. “That sounds easy, until you remember they’re 15,000 feet [4,500 metres] underwater,” Oliver argued. “The difficulty of picking up golf balls really does depend on where they are. If they’re on a driving range, sure, it’s no big deal. If they’re resting on a grizzly bear’s dick, then you know what? Maybe take a mulligan.” But Barron’s pitch “massively undersells the damage this could do”, starting with the fact that researchers estimate that 30-40% of species in the CCZ live on the nodules. “Just because creatures are small doesn’t mean they aren’t important to the ecosystem around them,” Oliver explained. Deep-sea mining, he continued, “could have irreversible impacts for everything, from microbes to gummy squirrels, and I literally only just learned they existed! I don’t want them to be destroyed unless I’m absolutely housing a family-sized bag of them.” For one, giant harvesting vehicles would create plumes of sediment that could do immense damage – burying fields of nodules, choking the filters of anemones and sponges living outside the mining zone, and obscuring bioluminescence used by fish and squid to hunt and mate. “Basically, it could fuck everyone’s shit up,” said Oliver. “Think less ‘gently lifting golf balls off the driving range’ and more ‘a scene from Dune 3: Even More Sand.’” The Metals Company insists that research it commissioned shows the damage will be minimal, but “even more research that it didn’t commission suggests otherwise”, Oliver countered. One study found that even 26 years following extraction, the deep-sea ecosystem had not returned to its previous state. And that ecosystem is important: deep-sea creatures help expand scientists’ understanding of medicine and the development of new drugs, and its microbes are an essential part of Earth’s carbon cycle. “So you want to be absolutely sure that that is not jeopardized by deep-sea mining, and we are not sure about that at all,” said Oliver. Oliver lamented that, given the risks, there are few regulations protecting the deep sea from private mining. The UN’s International Seabed Authority (ISA), established in 1982, technically manages most of the sea floor, though the US under Reagan refused to ratify it. And there are concerns the agency may be comprised – its secretary general, Michael Lodge, appeared in a video for Barron’s mining company, and the board has never rejected a mining application. “It’s not ideal that a body responsible for something as important as protecting the deep sea has lower standards than the University of Phoenix,” Oliver noted. The ISA has a complicated jurisdiction over the sea floor, and is supposed to preserve half of it for the interests of smaller nations – which is how The Metals Company is involved, as it struck a deal with Nauru. Under the terms, Oliver explained, the tiny Pacific island nation devastated by phosphorous mining will receive 0.5% of profits. While Barron has insisted that “Nauru is no one’s puppet,” said Oliver, “there is a clear power disparity between an international mining firm hoping to make billions of dollars, and an environmentally ravaged island with a population of just 12,000 people.” Nauru triggered a mechanism whereby the ISA must start accepting deep-sea mining applications, even if mining regulations aren’t set. Barron has told investors that he expects to begin production by the first quarter of 2026. Oliver was skeptical of the costs versus payoff of deep-sea mining: “If these nodules really could provide nearly unlimited energy for billions of people, I’d say maybe it’s worth thinking about, but the truth is, they may not be as critical for our clean-energy future as Barron insists,” as new battery technology does not use nickel or cobalt at all. Instead, Oliver argued that the US should join other countries in calling for a precautionary moratorium on deep-sea mining, and finally join the ISA. “Ultimately, it’s going to take us having the patience to wait for the science on this and the discipline to actually listen to what it has to say,” he said. “And I know that that’s hard to do, because it’s so much easier to just pull out a rock and call it the savior of humanity.” Nevertheless, “it is beyond time that we stop treating the deep ocean as something to exploit,” he concluded, “and start treating it for what it really is: a mind-blowingly vast, virtually unknown world within our world.”"

        "Titre": "Sliver of cool surface water 2mm deep helps oceans absorb CO2, say scientists",
        "Auteur": "Steven Morris",
        "Date": "2024-10-25",
        "Texte": "A sliver of cool surface water less than 2mm deep helps oceans absorb carbon dioxide, a British-led team of scientists has established after months of voyages across the Atlantic painstakingly measuring gas and temperature levels. The subtle difference in temperature between the “ocean skin” and the layer of water beneath it creates an interface that leads to more CO2 being taken in, the scientists observed. They used highly sensitive equipment to measure the water temperature and to spot and record tiny differences in the amount of CO2 in the air swirling towards the ocean surface and away again. The work is seen as important in the development of climate modelling because oceans absorbs about a quarter of human carbon emissions. Daniel Ford, a research fellow at the University of Exeter, said: “With the Cop29 climate change conference taking place next month, this work highlights the importance of the oceans, but it should also help us improve the global carbon assessments that are used to guide emission reductions.” Ford was onboard the research ship RRS Discovery, which sailed between Southampton and Punta Arenas in Chile. He said: “The cruise involved seven weeks of keeping all the different instrumentation working together to collect the wide array of measurements used in the study. “We went through very rough seas in the north Atlantic and near the Falklands, which was challenging, but we had respite when near the equator with mirror glass ocean.” The 2mm sliver of water is slightly colder because of the “cool skin effect”, which is caused by heat leaving the water as it is in direct contact with the atmosphere. The results, published in the Nature Geoscience journal, have been passed on to the Global Carbon Budget assessment, a worldwide consortium of scientists set up to establish a common understanding of the Earth’s carbon cycle. Prof Jamie Shutler, an ocean and atmospheric scientist at the University of Exeter, said the “ocean skin” was very slightly cooler than the layer of water beneath it. The absorbing of CO2 is controlled by the concentration difference in gases across these layers. Shutler said the effects were first suggested in the early 1990s. “But the key missing piece – the field evidence – eluded us,” he said. Gavin Tilstone, from Plymouth Marine Laboratory, said: “This discovery highlights the intricacy of the ocean’s water column structure and how it can influence CO2 drawdown. Understanding these subtle mechanisms is crucial as we continue to refine our climate models and predictions. It underscores the ocean’s vital role in regulating the planet’s carbon cycle and climate.”"

        "Titre": "‘Deep in my madness, witches gave me hope’: Elizabeth Sankey on motherhood, depression and witches ",
        "Auteur": "Elizabeth Sankey",
        "Date": "2024-11-24",
        "Texte": "Four years ago, when my son was only one month old, he and I were admitted to a mother and baby unit, a psychiatric ward that cares for people with perinatal mental health issues and their babies. I was diagnosed with severe postpartum anxiety and depression, and placed on medication. I had weekly sessions with the psychiatric team about my progress, and my son and I spent time with the other women on the ward and their babies. Every day, sometimes twice a day, my husband would come and see us and we would walk around Hackney as I tried to remember who I once was, tried to resist the temptation to step in front of a car. Gradually, horrifically, painfully slowly, I got a bit better. After eight weeks we were discharged and we went home. But while I was no longer in a crisis situation, my mental health was extremely fragile. I had weekly calls with an NHS therapist who approached my illness in a methodical, precise way. She explained what was happening to me and why it had happened. I was desperate to put it all down to hormones, I wanted to run away from the corrupt version of myself and never think about her again, wanted to slice her out of my heart, my mind, bury her and spit on her grave. I was so embarrassed and ashamed of her, I hated her. But my therapist gently pushed back – it wasn’t just hormones, and I needed to find a way to accept that. Two months later, I was still not in my right mind, still plagued by the knowledge that I had imagined doing terrible, evil things to my son. I knew that those intrusive thoughts were caused by my illness, but that didn’t make them any easier to live with. It was at this point that I started thinking about witches. Although, to be fair, I have always thought about witches. Many women have. Even this year for Halloween, my son wanted to be the witch from Room on the Broom – which was annoying because I’d already bought him a skeleton costume. And lots of women have a favourite witch: Glinda from The Wizard of Oz, The Witches of Eastwick, Samantha in Bewitched, and – for me personally – Mildred Hubble (The Worst Witch). Witches represent female power and can be a celebration of our potency, but they are also often used as the embodiment of society’s ancient fears about women. Consequently many of us are afraid of turning into witches, transforming into hags and crones as we age, pushed to the edge of our communities, derided, ignored, hideous. For others, witches represent women who are out of control – they show us the dangers of an unhinged female, a vixen who doesn’t do as she is told. But I think for me, in that quiet, grey December, still so deep in my madness, witches represented hope. I made a list of every witch film I could think of and watched them one by one while my son slept on my chest. As I did so I found connection and comfort. But while once I had loved the “good” witches who were pink and maternal, who only used their power to change their outfit or help a friend, I was now increasingly drawn to “bad” witches. Maybe the Wicked Witch of The West had a point when she wailed, “what a world, what a world, what a world!” as she melted into a cold stone floor. I realised that actually what I needed was the courage to accept that the person I thought of as evil, pathetic and sick was, in fact, me. After that the bad witches became aspirational. They made me feel like I wasn’t alone. Maybe I wasn’t evil. Maybe I was just a witch? In the summer of 1645, Matthew Hopkins, one of the most famous “witch finders” to clomp around the country in his little heeled boots, arrived in Suffolk. By this point, witch trials had been happening in England for more than 60 years, and Hopkins was notorious for uncovering witches wherever he went. In breaks from films while my son drank warm formula from his bottle (told you I’m evil), I read through the testimonies of the women accused in this trial. Anna Moats had voluntarily confessed within two hours of her arrest. And the devilish deed she had performed? “Cursing her husband and children.” Anna knew that confessing to be a witch meant she would be put in a cart and driven through the streets, before swinging from the gallows, in front of her friends, family, possibly even her children. And yet she still confessed. I called Marion Gibson, Professor of Renaissance and Magical Studies at Exeter University and asked why someone like Anna would confess – was it because of torture? “No, witches weren’t tortured in England.” My voice caught in my throat. So some women confessed without torture? “Yes.” And they knew they would die? “Yes. And no one is sure why they did that.” Huh. I have a theory. To clarify – while there wasn’t torture, they did use sleep deprivation and intimidation. And they searched the women’s naked bodies for marks of the devil, which would have led to many coerced confessions. However, thanks to Professor Louise Jackson’s research, I learned that in a few of the Suffolk depositions, confessions had been made “freely”. Matthew Hopkins wrote that Rebecca Morris “confessed before any violence, watching [sleep deprivation] or other threats” that the devil came to her in the shape of a boy. Alicia Warner “freely being at her liberty confessed that she had entertained certain evil spirits”. Eliza Southerne confessed immediately, “The minister used no other argument to make her confess… [only] saying do wrong yourself, but clear your conscience.” Very little research has been done into these “voluntary confessions” or why these women were so ready to condemn themselves to death. But reading through their testimonies I felt as if I knew. Scrolling through phone conversations I have with the women in my life, I felt like I knew. The guilt and the shame so many of us feel at not being good enough. The suffocating pressure we feel to be perfect. As Professor Louise Jackson writes, “In the production of confessions, coercion was as much cultural as it was physical. Frameworks of belief about women’s roles, responsibilities and expectations would lead women to condemn themselves… The Suffolk women who confessed that they were witches were also confessing that they were ‘bad’ mothers, ‘bad’ wives and ‘bad’ neighbours…” In my opinion very little has changed. They don’t need to torture us, we will do it to ourselves. I also saw descriptions of mental illness within the confessions. Back then suicide attempts and depression were almost always linked to the devil, and those ideations feature prominently in the women’s testimonies. Lidea Taylor confessed “that her imps… counselled her to kill herself”. Ellen Greenelif confessed that “she was often tempted to kill herself”. Elizabeth Fillet confessed that “the devil tempted her to kill herself”. I also saw hints of postpartum depression and psychosis. Prissilla Collit confessed that the devil had tempted her to kill her children. She placed one of her children next to the fire to burn it, a sibling pulled it away. Mary Scrutton confessed that the “devil appeared to her twice, once like a bear, once like a cat and tempted her in a hollow voice to kill her child”. Susanna Smith confessed the day after her arrest that 18 years previously the devil had appeared to her in the form of a shaggy red dog and tempted her to kill her children. I contacted Dr Trudi Seneviratne, a psychiatrist who has saved countless lives through her work at the Bethlem Mother and Baby unit, part of South London and Maudsley hospital. She nodded as she read the testimonies from 1645, recognising symptoms of postpartum mental health illness. She said that even today the devil still appears in cases of psychosis, women will see themselves as witches, hear satanic voices telling them to do terrible things. One of the most tragic cases of postpartum psychosis happened in 2001 when Andrea Yates, a Texan mother, drowned all five of her children in the bathtub during a psychotic episode. Yates later said that she thought she was a bad mother and had condemned them to hell. When I read about Andrea and her family I sobbed. While I didn’t have psychosis I knew how close I had come to her experience. Many of my symptoms were similar to hers – mania, restlessness, depression. I was withdrawn, tearful, my anxiety so severe I couldn’t sleep. Most alarming, though, was that a few days before I was admitted to hospital I started to believe that ending my son’s life was the only way out of the torture I was experiencing. If I hadn’t received help so quickly, who knows what would have happened – women with these illnesses can deteriorate shockingly quickly. Postpartum psychosis symptoms usually start within hours or days of giving birth and presentations can change within minutes. For a general patient suffering from psychosis it could take months to see the same changes. It’s one of the rare instances where a psychiatric episode is considered an emergency. I think about Andrea all the time. She currently lives in a low-security state mental hospital and though she has been eligible for release for many years, she always refuses. Thankfully cases like hers are not common, but they still happen, and while in the UK the Infanticide Act, which was re-enacted in 1938, ensures lenient sentencing for a mother who kills her child during the first year of its life, in the US there is no such protection. On 4 January 2023, Lindsay Clancy of Massachusetts strangled her three children then slit her wrists and jumped out of a window. She survived, but her children did not. Now paralysed from the waist down, she’s on trial for homicide. Clancy, whose youngest child was only eight months old when he died, said she strangled the children during a “moment of psychosis”. The prosecution are depicting her as a sociopath who murdered her children, then faked a suicide attempt. They claim she’d been behaving normally on the day of the tragedy and had never mentioned anything suggesting a psychotic break, just “a touch of postpartum anxiety”. Any woman who has experienced perinatal mental health illness will not be surprised that Clancy was reticent to talk explicitly about what was happening to her. My friends and family were incredibly supportive during my illness, but I was scared to tell them everything I was thinking and feeling. Including how, in the days before my hospitalisation, my brain had started playing a constant loop of hideous scenes. I saw myself smothering our son with a pillow, dropping him from a window on the third floor, drowning him in the bathtub. And yet I loved him more than I had ever loved anyone or anything. It was so scary, so horrifying. I didn’t want to burden them, but also I didn’t want it to be true. So I would convince myself I was making a big deal out of nothing. What finally shifted things for me was joining Motherly Love, a support group filled with women from different backgrounds who have experienced perinatal mental health issues. All of them understood. Whatever terrifying thoughts I was having, someone else had had them, too, and they’d survived. The group became a vital source of hope, support and anecdotal knowledge, which didn’t seem to be accessible anywhere else. It was those women who recognised the severity of my symptoms and urged me to get immediate care. They saved my life simply by sharing how they were feeling and making sure I knew I wasn’t alone. Suicide continues to be the leading cause of maternal death between six weeks and 12 months after birth, accounting for 39% of deaths in this period. And despite increased funding and awareness, suicide rates have increased 15% in 10 years. I think a huge part of that is the suffocating pressure women feel to be perfect. My illness began with hormones, but was exacerbated by the stigma, guilt and shame that started the second I left hospital with my tiny son and realised I’d unlocked the door to yet another torture chamber for women. We must be mothers and when we’re mothers, we must be perfect mothers. We must breastfeed our babies, they must sleep well, if they’re in childcare it has to be the very best childcare, we have to be killing it in our careers, and still be present and calm for our children, we must stay youthful, we cannot put on weight. We must behave. And above all, we must be good. It is impossible, we all know it is impossible, and yet we keep trying, and we keep failing, and when we fail we internalise the shame and the guilt because that is what we have been conditioned to do, and it eats away at us. Going through my illness has changed me in so many ways, but I think the greatest gift it has given me is the realisation there are infinite ways to be a woman. And I’ve given up on being a good mother – I failed at that after only one month. Which is actually incredibly liberating. These days I just feel so lucky to still be here. To hold my son’s warm body every morning when he wakes up, to watch him eat a slice of birthday cake in rapturous silence. I am lucky I have been given the opportunity to feel acceptance and even love for that dark twisted version of myself I once hated so much. I would miss her if she ever went away. And I am so lucky that I get to age. Far too many of us don’t. I plan to fly towards it like the witch I am, wild and mad, flawed and imperfect.

        "Titre": " Norway sued over deep-sea mining plans",
        "Auteur": "Karen McVeigh",
        "Date": "2024-05-23",
        "Texte": "One of the world’s biggest environmental groups is suing the Norwegian government for opening up its seabed for deep-sea mining, claiming that Norway has failed to properly investigate the consequences of this move. WWF-Norway says the government’s decision has breached Norwegian law, goes against the counsel of its own advisers, and sets a “dangerous precedent”. “We believe the government is violating Norwegian law by now opening up for a new and potentially destructive industry without adequately assessing the consequences,” said Karoline Andaur, the CEO of WWF-Norway. “It will set a dangerous precedent if we allow the government to ignore its own rules, override all environmental advice, and manage our common natural resources blindly.” In January, Norway became the first country in the world to give the go-ahead to commercial deep-sea mining after parliamentary approval. This was despite warnings from scientists of “catastrophic” consequences for marine life, and growing opposition from the EU and the UK, which support a temporary ban on environmental grounds. The proposal, which relates to Norwegian waters in the sensitive Arctic region, will expose an area of 280,000 sq km – larger than Britain. Mining the deep sea involves the extraction of metals and minerals from the seabed and is being pursued because of their use in the transition to green energy, particularly electric car batteries. WWF-Norway said that the assessment by the Norwegian energy ministry, which underpins the government’s decision to go ahead with deep-sea mining, fails to meet the minimum requirements of the Seabed Minerals Act and has no legal basis. The Norwegian Environment Agency, which advises the government, has also said the impact assessment does not provide a sufficient scientific or legal basis for deep-sea mining. Commenting on the lawsuit, Astrid Bergmål, the secretary of state at the Ministry of Energy, said: “We believe that a thorough process has been carried out with broad involvement, and that the applicable requirements have been followed. I note that WWF wants to try the case in court, and they have the right to do so. At this time, we have no further comment on the lawsuit.” Last year, a Norwegian study said it had found a “substantial” amount of metals and minerals on its seabed. In February, the European parliament expressed concern over Norway’s decision to open areas of the Arctic for deep-sea mining and called on member states to support a moratorium, including at the International Seabed Authority. The authority is expected to meet later this year, to ratify rules on mining in international waters. So far, 25 countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Palau, Mexico and Sweden, have asked for a pause, moratorium or ban on mineral extraction of the seabed."

        "Titre": "Deep mantle movements help explain Earth’s mysterious bulges",
        "Auteur": "Kate Ravilious",
        "Date": "2024-06-26",
        "Texte": "The constant movement of Earth’s tectonic plates reshapes our planet on a daily basis, but deep mantle processes also play a role, recent research shows. Many of Earth’s most significant features sit on plate boundaries: mountain ranges such as the Himalayas appear where continental plates collide; volcanoes and ocean trenches like those around the Pacific Ocean occur where ocean plates dive beneath continental ones. But our planet also has many surface features that sit far from tectonic plate boundaries and cannot be explained so easily. To better understand these mystery features, researchers compared crustal thickness data with mantle measurements, to identify locations where differences in the temperature and chemistry of the mantle were likely to be creating bulges and basins on Earth’s surface. Their findings, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, show that areas where the mantle is hot produce some of the largest bulges (up to 2km high and stretching across hundreds of kilometres), such as the Afar-Yemen-Red Sea region, western north America and Iceland. Meanwhile, cool mantle regions produce deep basins such as those found around the Black, Caspian and Aral seas, and in the East European Plain. Such features develop slowly over millions of years but are fundamental to geological processes such as erosion and sedimentary deposition."

        "Titre": "Riefenstahl review – deep-dive study takes down the Nazis’ favourite director",
        "Auteur": "Xan Brooks",
        "Date": "2024-08-29",
        "Texte": "Leni Riefenstahl returns to the Venice film festival, after a fashion, as the star of Andres Veiel’s extraordinary deep-dive documentary about the original cancelled artist. It was here, at Mussolini-era Venice in 1938, that Riefenstahl scooped the top prize for Olympia, her sublime, suspect paean to the Berlin Olympics. Her career hit the heights on the Lido, after which it plunged straight to hell. Veiel’s film shows how it happened, and how she tried and failed to salvage her reputation. Riefenstahl does not come to praise or reclaim the late director, but nor does it mean to bury her. It acknowledges her as a trailblazer: a driven female artist in a male-dominated industry whose poetic eye and technical nous turned the medium on its head (literally so in the case of Olympia, with its slow-motion divers and discus throwers). But the film also demonstrates the ways in which her work is inextricably linked to nazism – fuelled by it, defined by it – that it can never be viewed in isolation, as something pure and untouched. In furiously protesting that it should, the director embarked on an endless, irresolvable argumentative loop. Riefenstahl’s defence, for the record, was that she was an artist not a politician, a slave to beauty and therefore a little naive in allowing herself to be co-opted and commissioned by Hitler and Goebbels. Triumph of the Will, her 1935 salute to the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, wasn’t propaganda, she says, but a film “about peace and work”. The body fascism of Olympia, moreover, was colourblind, free from racial prejudice and could just as easily be applied to Jesse Owens as to the Fuhrer’s Aryan supermen. “Art is the opposite of politics,” she explains. And besides, “anyone would have done” what she did at the time. “Should I have been a resistance fighter?” she scoffs when confronting a critic on a 1970s chatshow. Riefenstahl, then, claimed innocence and ignorance. The evidence suggests otherwise. Veiel’s film quotes from a gushing letter she wrote to Hitler while on tour with her work (“the film’s impact as German propaganda is greater than I could have imagined and your image, my Fuhrer, is always applauded”). It covers her marriage to Peter Jacob, a committed Nazi, and her lifelong “rapport” (her words) with the Reich minister Albert Speer. Riefenstahl also denied any knowledge of the death camps, but may have indirectly caused a massacre when she ordered Jewish workers to be removed so that she could shoot a street scene. And while she insisted that the Roma prisoners that she used as extras on her 1940 picture Lowlands were all later set free, the Roma community saw it differently. “I’m not saying Gypsies need to lie,” she says by way of reply. “But really, who’s more likely to commit perjury: me or the Gypsies?” Veiel gained unprecedented access to Riefenstahl’s personal archive and combed through film footage, audio, photos and writing to join the dots between the material that she decided to preserve and that which she chose to leave out. He paints a textured, complex portrait that feels close to definitive; a slice of dark history that speaks (eloquently, implicitly) to present-day tensions. Riefenstahl leads us from the director’s miserable childhood through to her later work with the Nuba people of Sudan, a project she hoped would bring about her redemption. But the film is at its most grimly compelling when it puts her on stage, pinned down by her accusers and fielding questions with a mix of wary contempt and sudden explosions of incandescent rage. Riefenstahl died aged 101 in 2003. In her later years she haunted the wings as a flayed, anguished ghost. Eyes glittering beneath a marcelled blond wig, she was like a Nazi-adjacent Norma Desmond, complaining that she was still big, it was only the world that had shrunk. “I’d always fought as if my life was at stake, until I’d got my own way,” she says at one point, and it seems that she did so right through to the end, clinging to her self-serving version of events and steadfastly refusing to admit any guilt. Behind a camera or in the editing room, the director prided herself on her ability to control the narrative. In Olympia she reversed the film to make the divers turn backwards, holding them in the air as if to defy the laws of gravity, performing gorgeous magic tricks in the service of Third Reich propaganda. In life, though, her story crash-landed with an ugly, back-breaking thud. • Riefenstahl screened at the Venice film festival."

        "Titre": "How I learned to meditate in Herefordshire",
        "Auteur": "Jane Dunford",
        "Date": "2025-01-07",
        "Texte": "There’s an itch on the end of my nose and I want to scratch it. Instead, I focus on slowly breathing in and out, noticing the sensation, but trying not to react. My feet feel numb and my hip is niggling from sitting still. I shift slightly on my cushion and try to concentrate on the air as it enters and leaves my nostrils. It’s day two of a 10-day silent Vipassana meditation course at Dhamma Dipa, a centre in Herefordshire’s Wye Valley. I’ve dabbled in various forms of meditation before, but this course – a real deep dive with 10 hours of meditation each day – is on a different level. According to the website, this is the minimum length of time needed to master the technique, so I’ve signed up in the hope it will kickstart a long-lasting practice. It’s a pretty drive through a landscape of rolling hills to the centre, in Pencoyd, 20 minutes from Ross-on-Wye. As I pull in, I’m tempted to turn around and run away. Do I really want to spend the next 10 days in silence? Who are all these weirdos who want to do the same? Once an old riding school, Dhamma Dipa is simple but comfortable, with tree-filled gardens and a large, light meditation hall. About 100 people are here and, soon after we arrive, we put mobile phones and reading and writing material into a locker – no distractions are allowed. After a simple dinner and introduction, silence begins and it’s early to bed (I’m in a single room, some people are sharing). I’m woken by the bell at 4am for morning meditation. It’s dark as I find a space in the hall. The 10 hours are interspersed with breaks (there’s a big vegetarian breakfast and lunch, as well as afternoon fruit and tea) and time to wander the woods. Each evening a videotaped lecture by the technique’s founder SN Goenka explains the next stage. It’s based on the teachings of Buddha, but not overtly religious. The main aim is to develop a non-reactive state of mind, one of “equanimity”, free from the constant flux of “craving and aversion”. We’re taught to pay attention to sensations in different parts of the body, to observe rather than judge it as good or bad. As the days pass, I’m rocked by a rollercoaster of emotions. I’m angry, I’m gripped by fear, I cry, I laugh. It’s tough. I want to leave. But slowly my mind becomes quieter. I notice a pain in my shoulder and as I accept, rather than fight it, it softens into the background. At one point, it’s as if my body dissolves entirely and I feel a peace I’ve never felt before. Silence becomes easier, too, and I relish not having to make small talk. On day 10 we are allowed to speak again, but I’m reluctant to converse with anyone. At a service station on the way home everyone seems so busy, the tabloid headlines scream doom and gloom and yet my head feels spacious and light. I go straight to a one-year-old’s birthday party and remain unusually calm amid the chaos. As months go by, my regular practice begins to wane. Still, each time I try, I drop into that space of stillness much more quickly and generally feel more balanced in all aspects of life. I’ve learned something that’s lodged in the core of my being – now it’s about finding the discipline to keep going. Courses at the Herefordshire Vipassana meditation centre run on a voluntary donation basis; students “pay it forward” by donating at the end of a course for a future attendee"

        "Auteur": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas, Claire Biddles, Shaad D'Souza, Jennifer Lucy Allan, Adrian Horton, Tara Joshi, Lauren Martin, Alexis Petridis, Will Pritchard, Dave Simpson, Laura Snapes and Daniel Dylan Wray",

        "Texte": "Phil Geraldi – AM/FM USA Who could read the description “truck stop concrète” and not be intrigued? The San Diego sound collagist Phil Geraldi’s two-track cassette for Not Not Fun sketches a journey across the American plains in which the glow of a gas station canopy is as integral to the landscape as the dust and cacti. He rides the radio dial as if it were a ferris wheel, creating a recurring flicker of pop into talk radio and classical into ambient beauty that then might break free from the static to forge its own soaring journey across an endless sky. On Chase Your Love, the pedal steel transcends its already innate beauty to find an elastic and joyous expression; elsewhere in this tapestry of transmissions, a rhythm guitar creates a clearing, followed by a pocket of watery submersion and then suddenly a sharp sodium glow and warm bass reminiscent of Yo La Tengo at their most spectral and ominous. Then comes a static swarm; then a blur of guitar akin to Roy Montgomery’s sound. The second piece, Oklahoma After Dark, is far less succulent and melodic, strafed with what might be sirens or animal cries, and a flickering sharpness that evokes panning for precious metals in the dirt. The KLF’s Chill Out is one obvious precursor (so much so it’s referenced in the Bandcamp blurb); the reverent space of both pieces would make it easy to pinpoint AM/FM USA as cosmic Americana were it not so appealingly grounded and keyed into the beauty in the mundane. Kudos to the excellent No Tags podcast for the tip: many, many plays later, it’s a trip I’ve not tired of making. Laura Snapes Charlotte Day Wilson – Cyan Blue For an album on which the tempo seldom ventures above a slow jam’s unhurried pulse, Cyan Blue is a curiously urgent-sounding piece of work. That’s partly because of the lyrics – Charlotte Day Wilson’s second solo album is based around songs that describe the arc of a relationship from first flush of romance to grief at its collapse, and its depiction of the latter stages is pretty stark, as evidenced by the emotional sucker punch of I Don’t Love You: “It’s more peaceful being heartbroken than crying every night for you.” And it’s partly because of the Canadian singer-songwriter’s voice, which is rich and passionate, but never tips into over-emoting: it brings a real vividness to the stuff she’s singing. But it’s mostly because of the sound, which feels like it’s in constant motion: itchily moving between lo-fi singer-songwriter confessional, R&amp;B and bedroom pop, never settling in one place for long enough to categorise it exactly. Cyan Blue has bold pop hooks – Snoh Aalegra’s guest vocal on Forever winds around a sample of the chorus from the Foundations’ oldies radio perennial Baby Now That I’ve Found You – next to moments where it sounds like a muffled recording of a rehearsal on the verge of falling apart, as on I Don’t Love You. There are Auto-Tuned vocals and snappy basslines beside out-of-tune pianos and scratchy guitars, everything pressed into the service of unfailingly beautiful songs. The overall effect is enthralling, consuming and gorgeous: by its conclusion, you feel as though you’ve been taken into someone’s confidence, a powerful, haunting experience. Alexis Petridis Magdalena Bay – Imaginal Disk Los Angeles-based duo Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin’s 2021 debut Mercurial World epitomised the contemporary pick’n’mix art of making music. The songs mirrored the pair’s interest in Yes-influenced prog, yacht rock and machine-polished hyperspace pop via elements of Britney, Kylie, Charli xcx, shoegaze, disco and EDM. Named to describe a distorted CD-shaped item inserted into a person’s forehead (and deriving from imaginal discs, structures within insect larvae that emerge to form parts of their adult bodies), the superior follow-up takes a similar approach but fuses the many strands into a more cohesive whole. Tenenbaum’s gentle, sometimes spoken, otherworldly vocals are framed within a collage of strings, synths, piano, horns and dramatic percussion. Using 27 additional musicians, the combined effect is a dream-like, kaleidoscopic rollercoaster ride through decades of pop and dance: spiritually rather than literally psychedelic. With their high TikTok presence, online fan community and alter egos, the duo have created a science-fiction alternative universe, but where Imaginal Disk could have been more escapist fantasy the songs also deal with the collision between the metaverse and harsh reality: war, TV/online addiction and the like. Such deeper themes are very subtle, delivered via opulent, lush production that never loses focus on the sweet pop smarts of Killing Time, the dreamy Image, the blissful Death &amp; Romance or Cry for Me’s glorious nods to disco, Abba and Cerrone. The 15 tracks are like a lot of things at once and at the same time not really like anything else around. Dave Simpson Karl D’Silva – Love Is a Flame in the Dark Heady with longing and the palpable ecstasy of love at first sight, Love Is a Flame in the Dark is something like a miracle: an entirely self-recorded, self-produced pop masterpiece made by a relative unknown from the UK’s musical underground. Based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Karl D’Silva has spent the past two decades playing saxophone with the esoteric and experimental likes of Thurston Moore and Ex-Easter Island Head. Now in his late 30s, D’Silva assumes the spotlight with his debut album, singing – and playing every instrument – on 10 songs that capture the exact moment when a crush turns all-encompassing. Like all the best pop, these songs sound meticulously crafted and as if they were conjured up on the spot. Nowhere Left to Run soars with rolling, metallic drums and the most celestial of synths; Wild Kiss is giddy and maximalist, its outsized emotions culminating in outrageous imagery (“We come together burning ultra-violet light”) and a bravura guitar solo. The album shares commonalities with giants of contemporary pop: the neo-1980s production of the 1975, the romantic heft of Carly Rae Jepsen, the audacity of Lady Gaga. In D’Silva’s muscular emotionality – and well-placed saxophone solos – there are echoes of Springsteen, and of Trent Reznor in his melodic sense and industrial-leaning production. D’Silva is clearly an avid music fan, but he alchemises his influences into a jewel-like form that is entirely his own. Claire Biddles Jordana – Lively Premonition Beyond the year’s brightest-coloured pop superstars, a seam of singer-songwriters have been opening a wood-panelled door into the mid-1970s world of Carole King, Karen Carpenter and soft rock, ranging from subtle and groovy (Clairo) to country-tinged (Kacey Musgraves). The very best of these is Jordana, a 24-year-old US artist who has a huge streaming audience primarily from her mini-album with dream-poppers TV Girl, but whose solo work truly stands apart. In rich but unfussy arrangements with strings, multitracked vocals and – a staple of this revivalist sound – flutes wafting this way and that, the songwriting is sophisticated and advanced. Her lyrics are studies of total infatuation, populated by vivid characters such as the dancefloor crush of Raver Girl and the hopelessly down-bad narrator of Like a Dog, but Jordana’s melodies are where she really thrives. Whether doing drowsy psychedelic ballads, musical theatre epics, strutting funk-pop or dreamy waltzes, everything comes with tunes as classic-feeling as those from the era they’re clearly inspired by. On highlight Wrong Love, the tune mooches around in the verses before tumbling downward in the chorus, mirroring the misfortune she has with a mismatched lover. This is vintage pop, in every sense. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Nap Eyes – The Neon Gate Nova Scotia indie-rock four piece Nap Eyes are erudite and brilliant, but they wear their genius lightly, like the ruffian boys in class who secretly got straight As. Their superlative fifth album The Neon Gate is painfully literary on paper – one highlight, Demons, is an adaptation of a Pushkin poem, while I See Phantoms of Hatred and of the Heart’s Fullness and of the Coming Emptiness lifts its lyrics from the Yeats poem – but it moves with appealing weightlessness. Listening feels like going on a long, aimless nature walk with a friend, fixating on bugs in the grass as they chatter mindlessly; lead singer and primary songwriter Nigel Chapman unspools his lyrics with a wiry, conversational baritone that’s familiar and unpredictable at the same time, a little like Jonathan Richman after a couple of CBD drinks. Aside from the specifics of Chapman’s voice, though, it’s hard to specifically place Nap Eyes in a scene or lineage: The Neon Gate sounds a little bit like a lot of things – Neil Young, the Shins, any number of buttoned-up 80s indie bands – but it has such a curious, idiosyncratic atmosphere that nothing feels quite right. I often imagine Nap Eyes as the house band at some kind of warmly lit saloon, playing their inviting, distended rock songs as groups of friends chat about politics and sloppily refill each others’ glasses of wine. Perhaps that’s because songs like Demons, a plush fable with a hypnotic, looping structure, or the bittersweet Isolation, which drags its feet toward a squally guitar solo conclusion, feel like the kind of songs you’d want to live with for ever. Shaad D’Souza Mk.gee – Two Star &amp; the Dream Police While the year in music deservedly belongs to the women of pop, alt-rocker Mk.gee has emerged as breakout, counterintuitive programming. The 28-year-old from Linwood, New Jersey, has become the word-of-mouth artist of the year, culminating in his Saturday Night Live debut, through a run of ecstatically received live performances and a visionary rejection of trends – experimentation over sleekness, mystique over relatability, a re-embrace of long obsolete classic rock. His virtuosic guitar playing and fuzzy, atonal distortion – honouring both 80s guitar legends and low-quality YouTube rips – have won a grab bag of celebrity fans, from Eric Clapton (“He has found things to do on the guitar that are like nobody else”) to Frank Ocean and Justin Bieber. Mk.gee’s debut album, Two Star &amp; the Dream Police, is just over 30 minutes of musical revelation – deceptively complex, sublimely discordant, skin-tinglingly melodic, like a peek of sun through afternoon rain. Much like his burgeoning image as a rock star, Mk.gee’s lyrics are murky and elusive, the personal lore oblique at best. But Two Star still evinces a potent yearning for something, be it love or perfection or transcendence. I cannot tell you what Are You Looking Up is about, but I do know it makes me feel like I should pray. Messy, idiosyncratic, soulful, alien, these 12 tracks sound like nothing else I’ve heard before, and yet are also familiar – like those inexpressible feelings, at once strange and understood. Adrian Horton Pataka Boys – Thugs from Amritsar Hunched over his laptop in a hospital room in Punjab, self-taught producer Kartik began crafting a series of luxe, Madlib-inspired tracks while his mother recovered from kidney failure. Perhaps this explains the frenzied, collagist nature of the extraordinary beats that would become Thugs from Amritsar: from plush Anita Baker and Latimore samples and careening old-school Bollywood strings to a cartoony cut from 1970s comedy actor Mehar Mittal. Though the desi references are niche, Kartik and UK underground rap veterans PAV4N and Sonnyjim’s joyous mission is to find the wider connective tissue between the hip-hop of India, its diaspora, as well as US and UK classics (including the wryly named track Dettwork South Asia). Mud Family’s Mongo lends his gruff tones to Bappi Lahiri; Delhi superstars Seedhe Maut appear on searing Guddi Check, spitting about colonialism; NYC’s Heems merits a shout out for the bar: “Only right wing we acknowledge is Bukayo Saka.” Nostalgic references to defunct Southall pub Glassy Junction sit amid lines that are harrowing (“Brexit lookin’ cute now we fearin’ for our lives”) and comical: a longstanding racist taunt turns flex, as “bud dinger/big tipper.” Out on Azadi, the Mumbai label renowned for promoting political artistry, the record confronts histories of empire and immigration in the same breath as being “in the trap eating saag and bread”. A pleasingly playful, original showcase of global talent, it’s fitting that “pataka” means firecracker in various south Asian languages: Pataka Boys’ debut is colourful, thrilling and explosive. Tara Joshi Rafael Toral – Spectral Evolution Spectral Evolution remains one of the most original records of the year – not for its structure, concepts or styles, but for the literal sounds that make it up, drawn from guitar and custom-made electronics performed by Portuguese artist Rafael Toral. Its 47-minute-long single track unfurls as if listening to a dawn chorus of strange animals and birds as the sun breaks over surreal western scenery – hootings, whistlings and twitterings sing out over oddly undulating tones, gathering in what must be the bendiest crescendo of the year, before a break into easy and luminous glassy tones, then a brief detour into plainly picked guitar. Taken as a whole, it is so very vivid, rousing and curious, managing to be like so many other things but standing apart from all of them, even within Toral’s own catalogue, in which it ranks as a high-water mark. Toral’s career stretches back decades, taking in guitar drone work influenced by ambient and jazz forms, then 13 solid years investigating electronic instrumentation on his Space Program project, which also comes to the fore on this album with its in-house choir of singing sentient beings. We often talk of visionary albums, but Spectral Evolution should be celebrated for how visual it is, cracking open the listener’s mind’s eye to reveal an animated landscape populated by rare and exotic creatures. It should be no surprise it sold out multiple vinyl pressings upon release. Jennifer Lucy Allan Tim Reaper &amp; Kloke – In Full Effect For a label so steeped in jungle music – it runs like a motif through anchor artist Burial’s moody output, and was one of founder-producer Kode9’s formative musical obsessions – it’s surprising that it’s taken this long for Hyperdub to put out an album dedicated to the sound. In Full Effect more than delivers on that score: there are more breaks here than a fracture clinic, and basslines that bump and rumble like a London bus. As a survey of the genre, In Full Effect is as thorough as it is lovingly infatuated. Both Tim Reaper and Kloke are devoted students of the scene. Kloke discovered and fell in love with the sound during its golden mid-90s era, while Reaper, barely a toddler then, spent his teens meticulously cataloguing the discographies of his favourite imprints. In accordance with this encyclopaedic approach, there’s something for every bleary-eyed raver here: tweaked organ licks and hardcore pianos on Juice; guttural Reese basslines on Alienation; the ragga reloads come courtesy of Roots &amp; Reality; while things get glitchy on Wildstyle. The whole thing is carried off with the sort of panache that’s only gained by playing, as Reaper has done, hundreds of 5am sweatbox sets. And so, more than just a survey of things passed, In Full Effect applies its creators’ purist approach to extending jungle’s legacy too, with everything aimed squarely where it is meant to be heard: on a barely lit dancefloor, in the wee hours of the morning. Will Pritchard High Vis – Guided Tour Guided Tour hits a lot of sweet spots. For hardcore devotees, it’s got the credentials: High Vis are made up of members of underground UK bands including Dirty Money. It’s also produced by Jonah Falco, drummer of long-running Canadian band Fucked Up. Gritty, punk-infused hardcore is the name of the game and Guided Tour’s tough moments are stellar: Mob DLA is a chest-thumper, with a gargantuan bassline and a gang vocal that will leave you hoarse: “Nothing ever comes to those who wait,” chants vocalist Graham Sayle in his thick scouse drawl, the anxious heat boiling over in the melody. Even if you’re not super into the heavy stuff, there’s still much to love. With its New Order-adjacent riffs, single Mind’s a Lie could leave the crowd at Glastonbury or Warehouse Project bouncing just the same. Listen closely, and Sayle roars about how austerity cuts to mental health services are crushing the people they’re meant to help. Thematically, Guided Tour lances what it means to live in Britain now: when the state abandons you, you’re broke and you’ve outgrown your shitty friends, what are you left with? And who are you, really? The anthemic swagger and psychedelic fuzz of Feeling Bless and Gone Forever feel none-more British, but it’s more Echo and the Bunnymen than Madchester, and thoroughly unburdened by pastiche. With its tough shell and soft underbelly, Guided Tour is a triumph. Lauren Martin Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou – Souvenirs Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou’s music is a revelation. In recent years, Mississippi Records has unearthed and released music by the late Ethiopian orthodox nun, a recluse who privately made beautiful piano compositions. Souvenirs elicits another discovery: she also sang. These recordings were discovered in a box of cassette tapes in her convent in Jerusalem after she died in 2023, originally recorded straight into a boombox that sat on top of her piano between 1977–1985. The result is a subtle yet powerful collection: the lo-fi recordings add an intimate and domestic warmth, like being sat in the room with a relative gently playing and singing in the corner while stunning the room into silence. Such is the homely feel you can even hear birds tweeting in the background. It’s also a pained yet spirited album, rooted equally in her pride in her home country as well as the anguish of displacement and the political turmoil taking place in Ethiopia at the time. On opener Clouds Moving on the Sky, she sings, in Amharic, “My heart has never stopped missing home.” Guèbrou’s piano playing is fluid and soothing yet also melancholic, with her gently soaring voice matching those movements and moods. Her pieces, while sharing some melodic phrases heard in Ethio-jazz, feel incredibly distinct – carved out by someone who clearly played intuitively and playfully for an audience of one. It’s a real privilege to sit alongside her and bask in this deeply personal yet quietly profound record. Daniel Dylan Wray"

        "Date": "2025-01-08",
        "Texte": "As someone who learned Latin at a bog-standard comprehensive in Sunderland, it was both cheering and depressing to read of Arlene Holmes-Henderson’s work to keep classics in the classroom (‘They see it is living’: Durham professor’s mission to get more pupils into classics, 2 January). My school was lucky in its classics teachers precisely because Durham produced such good graduates who could stay and work in the area. In the north-east, we were surrounded by the Romans, and learning Latin made more sense to me than learning French, where the chance to use the language beyond the classroom seemed much less likely than for Latin. But learning French (and every language I’ve attempted since) was benefited by the understanding of grammar that Latin instilled. I went on to use my Latin professionally, so it also gave me a career and a future – but even if it had not, the mental discipline and inherent interest involved in learning Latin laid down skills that have lasted a lifetime. Prof Lesley Smith Oxford • Teaching in a comprehensive school, staff were asked to add enrichment to the curriculum over six weeks with a personal enthusiasm. I introduced Latin and six weeks extended into years until I retired. In turn, students’ enthusiasm led to Latin GCSE and sixth-form AS classical civilisation and an unforgettable trip to Greece. Some students were inspired to study linguistics at university. Students see Latin “as living”, as Arlene Holmes-Henderson says. They claimed that Latin grammar made aspects of English and French studies much clearer and one student surprised his parents by suddenly spotting a gerundive in a London street, Bibendum. They found infinite connections in their lives: drama, poetry, medicine … I would encourage any teacher who would enjoy a challenge beyond their own subject to consider learning and teaching Latin to enrich their own, and students’, education and lives. Some teachers do both simultaneously. They and their students will experience the endless fascination of etymology. I was inspired by a wonderful teacher who taught my sons, and from this sprung a weekly group meeting to read Latin poetry with her that has lasted for more than 30 years.

        "Texte": "The far-right mob attack on two Israel Defense Forces bases in support of soldiers accused of sexually torturing a detainee did not come out of the blue – the parallels to a 2016 incident were immediately obvious. In March that year, Elor Azaria, an IDF soldier serving in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, calmly walked over to Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, an injured Palestinian knife attacker lying on the ground, and shot him in the head. A video of the killing released by a human rights group led to political uproar. IDF commanders and many political figures, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned Azaria’s actions as a breach of the military’s ethical codes that must be prosecuted. But the right-wing reaction was swift and fierce. Polls suggested that more than half the Israeli public supported Azaria, and protests were held in his defence. Both the political and military establishments in Israel have been willing to deny or turn a blind eye to the repeated allegations of torture at Sde Teiman Netanyahu, playing to his base, appeared to change his mind: the prime minister went on to criticise his generals for investigating Azaria, and eventually joined calls for the soldier’s pardon. Azaria served nine months of an 14-month sentence for manslaughter, and was released in 2018 to a hero’s welcome. A retaliatory rampage carried out by Israeli settlers on the Palestinian town of Huwara in February last year was another grim incident, as are continuing well-documented war crimes such as looting, and the burning of food supplies and homes by IDF soldiers in Gaza. But until this week, government ministers had refrained from acts of violence themselves. On Monday, Israeli military police raided Sde Teiman, an IDF base in the Negev desert that has turned into a notorious Guantánamo-like detention centre for Palestinians since the war in Gaza began, arresting nine soldiers suspected of severe torture and sexual abuse of a prisoner. The detainee, a member of Hamas’s elite Nukhba unit that carried out the 7 October attack, was admitted to hospital earlier this month and underwent surgery. The hospital is believed to have set off the investigation by following procedures for victims of sexual assault. What followed after news of the arrests spread was an astonishing insight into the political currents roiling Israeli society: about 200 right-wing demonstrators, including several members of the Knesset and government ministers, broke into the base in protest at the arrests and only dispersed several hours later after the reported use of teargas. Another confrontation then broke out between military police and soldiers, who barricaded themselves inside in solidarity with their arrested colleagues, Israeli media reported. There were also clashes with approximately 300 protesters at a military police base in central Israel, where demonstrators attacked journalists. The left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz described Monday’s events as evidence of a “deep moral deterioration that has developed during the long years of the occupation … along with the loosening of the rules and restraints”. Allegations of abuse of Palestinians detained en masse in Gaza and held at Sde Teiman are rife, but Monday’s arrests do not represent a newfound sense of responsibility towards Palestinian prisoners from the Israeli state. While the government has said it plans to move Palestinian detainees elsewhere, for now the base is still being used as a holding facility. Conditions for Palestinians held in regular Israeli prisons are not much better, and since 7 October Israel has broken international law by refusing to let Red Cross inspectors visit detention facilities. Investigations into alleged IDF abuses of Palestinians are vanishingly rare and prosecutions are even rarer. It seems that the only reason an inquiry was launched into this incident is because hospital officials who treated the victim off-base raised the alarm. If anything, it seems that heinous violence is becoming increasingly normalised in the latest round of bloodletting in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, set in motion by Hamas’s 7 October attack. A recent UN report has estimated 27 detainees have died in custody on Israeli military bases and at least four more have died in the Israeli prison system from beatings or denial of medical treatment since the war began. Both the political and military establishments in Israel have been willing to deny or turn a blind eye to the repeated allegations of torture at Sde Teiman, encouraging brutal treatment of prisoners and reinforcing a culture of impunity. A key principle of international law is complementarity, which prevents the international courts of justice at The Hague from pursuing war crimes charges if they are subject to credible state-level investigations or criminal proceedings. Prosecutors there will have noted Monday’s dramatic events in their efforts to determine whether Israel is able – or willing – to investigate itself. Israel’s enemies will also be watching, closely following what they see as internal disunity and weakness. The IDF said in a statement on Tuesday that the attacks were damaging to national security and three combat battalions scheduled for deployment to Gaza have instead been diverted to Beit Lid. The rioting at the army bases on Monday in defence of soldiers accused of terrible crimes was not the first recent indication of the Israeli right’s diminishing respect for human dignity and the rule of law. It is unlikely to be the last."

        "Titre": "‘The ungraspable phantom of life’: why puppetry is perfect for plumbing the deep mysteries of Moby-Dick ",
        "Auteur": "Sanjoy Roy",
        "Date": "2025-01-02",
        "Texte": "It is unnerving to be taken backstage after a show only to find yourself stepping over the inert, dismembered bodies of characters you’ve just seen in action. But this is Plexus Polaire, a French-Norwegian company that specialises in puppet theatre, and these players are just wood, foam and papier-mache. Yet their eerie fascination feels no less potent offstage than on, in the large-scale production of Moby Dick by the company’s founder and director, Yngvild Aspeli, based on Herman Melville’s novel. “Puppetry is like a ouija board,” she tells me later, on a video call from the arctic village of Stamsund, Norway, where she also directs Nordland Visual Theatre. “Even if you know someone is moving the glass, you still have that doubt: maybe it is moving by itself. The puppet is an object, but it is also a medium that can give access to what is invisible, to the other side of appearances. This is a theme that comes back in all of my shows.” Moby Dick, a centrepiece of this year’s MimeLondon festival, is the third Plexus Polaire piece I caught last autumn in France. Each is distinct in scale and subject, but all mix live actors with puppets, and share a profound sense of being haunted. In her remarkable version of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, Aspeli plays Nora, voicing both that character and the puppets who form her household, while spiders increasingly encroach upon her domesticity to undo what she thought was real, or imagined. In Dracula – Lucy’s Dream, Aspeli melds the figure of Lucy with the vampire’s brides in a psychosexual drama that tangles forbidden desires with fantasies of control and submission. Again, actors and puppets – the unliving and the undead – swap and sometimes merge roles. Moby Dick turns on the character of Ahab, his mind unmoored by oceanic visions of the infinite, obsessively hunting the white whale only because he is haunted by it. Earlier works likewise thrive on ambivalent scenarios: a man and his missing hand, an arsonist burned by inner demons, the troubled life and mind of radical feminist Valerie Solanas. All these are adult subjects given serious artistic treatments, and it strikes me that the question guiding Aspeli’s approach is not what theatre can do with puppets, but what puppets can do for theatre. Aspeli concurs. “I don’t use puppets to replace actors. Instead I ask: what can the puppet do that the actor cannot? What can the actor do that the puppet cannot? The relation between actor and puppet interests me very specifically, and it lets me work on parallel levels at the same time.” As a child in Norway, Aspeli already had those parallel interests: theatre, and making things with her hands. Initially she considered studying stage design but instead left for the famous Jacques Lecoq theatre school in Paris, where she gained a sense of the stage as a meeting place for many “languages” – physical, visual, verbal, musical – and then she attended the National School of Puppetry Arts in Ardennes. “For me,” she remembers, “puppetry became like another language, another way of communicating a story.” Nowhere is she more polyglot than in Moby Dick, which combines puppets, actors, props and models with text, lights, music (visceral rock, played live on stage for the MimeLondon season), and stage-spanning video projections that allow her to show the vanishing tail of the great white whale, or the slow passing of its enigmatic eye. “Moby Dick started from a sentence in Melville’s book that describes the ocean as a gigantic graveyard of people who have disappeared at sea,” she recalls. “I wanted this production to be like dead sailors retelling the story. Puppets can bring those characters to life, without being alive themselves.” Such equivocations between the living and the dead, between mechanics and metaphysics, make puppetry an apt medium. What the narrator Ishmael says of the sea could also be said of this art form: “It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.” It is also a novel about magnitude. “I use scale a lot in this production,” Aspeli continues. “I can zoom in and zoom out with different sized models. Moby-Dick is a story about nature and scale: how small we are in these little boats next to the whale or the ocean. How deluded is Ahab, who thinks he is somehow larger than life.” If Ahab’s hubris drives his personal drama, something else seems to drive Ahab: his secretive, close-at-hand crew of “five dusky phantoms” led by the mysterious Fedallah, Ahab’s “dark shadow” who delivers the prophecy that will seal his fate. “I think of the puppeteers as like Fedallah’s crew,” says Aspeli. “Sometimes they linger in the shadows, sometimes they are invisible. But they control the characters and their destiny.” A thought comes to her: “Did you know that in French, a puppeteer is called a manipulator? It’s very literal! I guess that makes me a professional manipulator.” We both laugh. But what moves her? She searches for words, then offers: “Puppetry has an aspect of something else that is in our self, somehow.” Something haunts her, too, then. MimeLondon begins on 14 January. Moby Dick is at the Barbican, London, 22-25 January. Sanjoy Roy’s trip to France was provided by the Barbican"

        "Texte": "I share John Harris’s concern (Opinion, 3 March) over Kindred2’s new study about an increase in the number of children starting school who are not “school-ready”, which reported that 28% of children in reception year “incorrectly use books (swiping or tapping as if using an electronic device)”. May I suggest another reason why young children now have difficulty learning to read? Many appear to have little verbal interaction with the adults in their life. In public I often see a parent with child in pushchair, the parent completely engaged on their mobile phone while the child, given a tablet to keep them quiet, taps and swipes distractedly as the screen changes. In contrast, in a pre-digital age children in prams and pushchairs sat facing their parent as they walked along, able to engage in a lively exchange, the child cooing and gooing in conversation and in so doing developing muscularity in the speech organs. Aged 81, I am one of a dying species: a speech teacher. Over the years, I have seen fashions in speech change from the elocution of queen’s English, through “estuary” to the more recent embrace of regional accents. One thing has remained the same: the necessity of speaking clearly and fluently in order to communicate effectively. It has been my privilege and delight to volunteer in local schools since the 1970s, most recently as a trustee of a multi-academy trust; I was asked to help the reception class of a local primary school where learning to read was a major problem for some pupils, because they couldn’t form the sounds of our language. They lacked basic verbal dexterity, having little tongue and lip muscularity. A group was chosen to join me in the garden at lunch break, where we had great fun learning to stand up straight, fill our lungs with air and play with language sounds. In no time at all we were Humpty Dumpty’s soldiers, marching to “What a to-do to die today at a minute or two to two, A thing extremely hard to say and harder still to do,” and so on. Dubbed “the poetry group” by the other children, it became the “go to” activity, as others joined in. When children can speak, they can learn to read, so access to books becomes a joy. We all have a role to play to ensure this is so. Janice White East Bridgford, Nottinghamshire • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "Titre": "Learning carpentry from my father helped make me the person I am",
        "Auteur": "Callum Robinson",
        "Date": "2024-09-15",
        "Texte": "Alone with my thoughts at the workbench, with the sanding machine’s insistently buzzing bass note singing up through my palm, I find myself trying to figure out just how long I have actually spent sanding pieces of wood. Softening their edges, making their surfaces gleam like polished marble. Carefully climbing through the grades – from the brutally coarse “low-grit” stuff to such improbably fine “high-grit” paper that the business side feels smoother than the backing. Or just how long I have spent working with wood all told, come to that. Professionally, I’ve been at it in some form or another for more than two decades now; and, before that, from almost the moment I was old enough to sweep up the shavings, I’ve been helping my father. The man who taught me the trick of folding and sticking the sandpaper together the better to grip it; of dampening the timber to bring up those last few stubbornly crushed fibres like blades of grass after rain. Sums on this scale are rather too grand for my sawdust-and-whisky-addled brain to compute, though, so, pulling off my ear defenders, I ferret out a calculator – and rather wish I hadn’t. Forty thousand hours is a long time to have dedicated to anything – especially something so seemingly menial as woodwork. Life is fleeting. There are meadows to skip through, kisses to steal and mountains to climb. There are just so many episodes of Grand Designs to watch. The very idea that, to date, I have spent close to 10% of my days on earth diligently chopping and shaping and rubbing dried plants with rough paper is frankly hard to even contemplate. And yet the more I stop and think about it, the more it makes me smile. I was 19 when it all began for me in earnest; when my father dropped the question over eggs and bacon that would go on to change and forever entwine both our lives. I’d been pulling pints in a country pub for months, watching the world pass me by through the window’s dimpled glass and drinking up my pay before it could get too friendly with my wallet. Sensing I was drifting, even if I could not, my parents threw me the only lifeline they had. Dad had been quietly making a name for himself for a while by then, fashioning wooden trinkets, furniture and even whole kitchens in the low stone garage he romantically referred to as “the workshop”. I’d pitched in plenty of times before. Was I interested in joining him full-time, he asked, that morning over breakfast. His offer carried with it the disagreeable whiff of hard labour, but there was little else on the horizon. I’d let university slip through my fingers, I had no plans or ambitions, no prospects at all really. And though I had no real notion of what working with my father, or with my hands, would really be like on a full-time basis, I had just enough sense to recognise an opportunity. Try to imagine being penned into a cramped tin-roofed shed (glacial in winter, Saharan in summer), just you and your father for months and then years on end. You’re at the very apex of your teenage worst, while the old man – self-taught, cash-strapped and woefully under equipped – is making it all up more or less as he goes along. Sparks flew daily, of course, as I’d guess he knew they must. The air around us crackled and fizzed with tension. But the natural teacher in my father loved his subject far too much to ever let my adolescent mood swings ruin his fun for long. It was here that I blundered and grumbled my way through those early days, clubbing and burning and slicing little pieces of my fingertips away. Watching and absorbing. Hoping (mostly in vain) that the work might eventually start to make some sort of sense. And, truthfully, though even with a gun to my head I’d never have admitted it, that I might have finally found a way to make him proud. I know now that all he ever really wanted was for me to love it as much as he did – the freedom and the creativity, the intoxicating smell of sawdust and self-reliance. But you don’t see those kinds of things when you’re young, do you? At least I didn’t. Using a flexible steel ruler, I grip and tear away six fresh inches of sandpaper, fold and tape it back to itself so that my fingers will find purchase on the gritty surface. Then couching it into the soft meat of my palm, working with the grain and with my whole body, I start in on the final stages. Without the electric thrum of machines all I can hear is my breathing and the rhythmic swish of the paper. And soon wisps of fine sawdust are curling like smoke beneath the skylight, so that I can almost taste it in the air. Sanding like this is not basic or easy, as one might imagine, though it was one of the first jobs entrusted to me as a clumsy apprentice. Much as you might want to, you cannot put back what you have abraded away. There is care and tenderness, intimacy about it, too. Indeed, the longer I do it, the more I’ve come to realise just how powerfully it connects you with the wood’s distinct characteristics, with the living material beneath your hands – part of a tree that might have stood for a century or more. As one so seldom is these days, when every waking moment seems to be spent neck-deep in a mire of distraction, by necessity, you are present. But unlike so many of the more complicated and even dangerous aspects of fine woodwork, your concentration can and does begin to wander. The sheer mind-numbing repetition often demands it. Physically engaged, almost hypnotically tuned into the rigours of the job, but mentally at times becoming so detached it can almost feel like an out-of-body experience. It gives you a lot of space to think. By the time I really hit my stride, I was in my mid-20s. My hands had grown harder and they seemed to know where they were supposed to be most of the time. Jobs moved faster, it all felt more assured. I’d started to discover what responsibility looked like – whether I wanted to or not. Learning what it really took to put food on the table every day, no matter the hours or the sacrifices it might take. Despite myself, I’d come to relish the prospect of rolling open the workshop door every morning. Working so closely with my father, I was coming to see a very different side of him as well. All that time spent laughing and struggling and sweating side by side, speaking by then in a shorthand born of old jokes, proximity and the daily promise of pain. It happened so gradually it barely registered, but little by little we were becoming a team. Evolution doesn’t always move so slowly, though, sometimes something incendiary happens. Something that alters everything that comes after. For me that something was the knee-trembling, life-changing magic of two dimensions becoming three; of inanimate sticks being given life and form. It happened one morning, alone and aghast at my workbench, when all of a sudden it wasn’t a delicate oak framework I was assembling any longer. It was an identity. A calling. Perhaps even a future. What I would come to discover in time is that woodwork requires far more than just tools and timber, or even a sharp set of skills. Like all creative work, to keep at it through thick and thin, and to actually make a living at it in the modern world, requires patience, forethought, invention and discipline. All qualities I sorely lacked when I was young. Where would I be now, I wonder, if I hadn’t spent the time I have making things with my hands. If all this enforced reflection, something my pathologically impatient mind would never knowingly have sat still for, hadn’t been a crucial part of my working week. Would I have had the self-belief to build a business, and a home, with my wife? Or marshalled the force of will it took to finish writing a book? The reality, I think, is that all the time I’ve spent detached from the noise of the world, listening to the messages pulsing up through the tips of my fingers and the thoughts swirling in my head, has allowed me to work away at things. To carefully shape ideas, and my character, as I have shaped the timber. It has helped me to grow and to find perspective, and to forge a bond with my father that few ever have the chance to experience. Strange as it sounds, I think that working with wood – even sanding pieces of wood – has made me who I am. And with that happy thought, I pull on my ear defenders and get back to work.

        "Titre": "The deep history of British coal – from the Romans to the Ratcliffe shutdown",
        "Auteur": "Jillian Ambrose",
        "Date": "2024-09-30",
        "Texte": "Britain’s transition to a low-carbon future has reached a milestone with the closure of its last remaining coal-fired power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire. The shutdown of the 57-year-old power plant on Monday ends more than 140 years of coal power generation in the UK – an industrial story closely interwoven with Britain’s socioeconomic and political history. Between the point when Britain’s first coal power plant began generating in 1882 until Ratcliffe’s closure, the UK’s coal plants burned through 4.6bn tonnes of coal and emitted 10.4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to analysts at Carbon Brief, more than most countries have ever produced from all fossil fuel sources. The end of an era has been welcomed by trade unions, green campaigners and politicians as an exemplar for how polluting industries can be wound down while safeguarding its labour force and communities. It also provides a chance to look back and reflect on the central role coal has played in powering modern Britain: The coal revolution Britain’s reliance on coal dates back to the Roman empire. The British Geological Survey believes the Romans may have begun mining in the Nettlebridge area of Somerset, England, close to the Fosse Way, to source coal used as fuel to heat baths and forge iron. But it was the Industrial Revolution when coal came into its own as a crucial driver of Britain’s emerging industrial might. Demand for coal exploded in the 1700s thanks to a population boom. Initially, the nascent British mining industry struggled to keep up with demand, but the invention of the steam engine in 1712 unlocked the potential of Britain’s abundant reserves in the coalfields of central Scotland, south Wales, the Midlands and north-east England. Coal-driven Newcomen engines pumped out the water that regularly flooded the mines, affording access to deeper and more plentiful reserves. In the early 1700s, about 3m tonnes of coal were mined every year – a number that exploded to more than 30m tonnes by the 1830s. In the early 1800s, coal was used to make town gas for lighting and to fuel the expansion of Britain’s burgeoning railways. But it was only in 1882 that Britain opened the world’s first public coal-fired power station at London’s Holborn Viaduct. The plant, built by Thomas Edison’s Edison Electric Light Company, initially generated enough electricity for almost 1,000 street lights from Holborn Circus to St Martin’s Le Grand as well as private residences. Other small-scale coal power plants followed. The fossil-fuel century At the start of the 20th century almost 100% of Britain’s electricity was generated by coal plants. By 1950, its dominance remained largely unchallenged at 96%, and in the late 1960s and 1970s Britain’s state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board ushered in a new generation of super coal plants. In 1966, Ferrybridge C began generating electricity on the River Aire in West Yorkshire. It opened with a generating capacity of 2,000 megawatts from four 500MW units, the first in Europe to create electricity from a generating unit of this size. Within two years, coal plants of a similar size mushroomed up across Britain’s coalfields: Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Cottam and West Burton A all began generating power in Nottinghamshire; and the Eggborough power plant started operations in North Yorkshire. By the end of the decade, the Ironbridge and Rugeley coal power plants began generating power in the West Midlands. In total, about 12 power stations of this scale began generating electricity in the years between 1966 and 1974, culminating in the giant Drax plant in North Yorkshire. After a sharp slump during the 1984-1985 miners’ strike coal power failed to return to the highs recorded at the start of the decade. By the 1990s, Britain’s dash for gas power and rising environmental concerns spelled the beginning of a long existential decline for coal. Powering past coal The millennium began with coal accounting for 36% of the UK’s electricity; with newer gas power plants and nuclear reactors playing a larger role in the power system. Coal plants became increasingly expensive to run owing to regulations that called for costly upgrades to help reduce pollution. By 2008, the UK government passed the Climate Change Act – mandating an 80% cut overall in six greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 – raising questions over the future of coal generation, which produces double the carbon emissions of newer gas power plants. In 2013, a new tax designed to top up the cost of carbon emissions tipped the scales further in favour of gas. The tax was largely responsible for the shutdown of 10 of the UK’s largest coal power plants over the next decade. In 2015, the government set out plans to end all coal-fired power generation entirely by 2025. In the same year, global governments met in Paris for the UN climate talks, leading to the 2016 Paris climate agreement to keep the rise in global surface temperature to well below 2C. By 2020, coal power had dwindled to just 1.8% of the UK’s electricity mix, and in 2021 the government brought forward the ban to October 2024. The decision to hasten the end of Britain’s coal power era was announced just months before the UK hosted the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow, where calls to phase out coal took centre stage. The Ratcliffe plant had originally planned to shut in late 2022 but its owner, the German energy company Uniper, later said it would keep the plant running during the Europe-wide gas crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine under an agreement with the government. Michael Shanks, the minister for energy, said the closure marked the end of an era, adding: “Coal workers can be rightly proud of their work powering our country for 140 years. We owe generations a debt of gratitude as a country.” • This article was amended on 30 September 2024 to include the Drax power station in the map, and to remove a graph showing the different types of fuel used in electricity generation in the UK from 1920 onwards."

        "Texte": "Barney Ronay’s article resonated very strongly with me (‘On a journey through Germany, the horror of the past lurks close to the surface’, Sport, 22 June). He spoke with clarity on how past horror echoed in his encounters with places and spaces in everyday Germany, from mundane buildings to the seemingly innocent woodland clearing. I too am from a “Jewish enough” family displaced from Nazi Germany. Our family has those seemingly improbable stories of survival, and I sometimes wonder if I should have existed at all. That Gestapo knock on the door has cast a long shadow and, throughout my “improbable” life, has caused me to ask how this terror arose. I wonder what its harbingers are, so we might not make such terror again. But right now we are witness to it. We can all see it raising its grotesquely mundane yet human head, with larger-than–life characters encouraging us to devalue and demean those who are different. So I ask your readers, can you learn the lessons of history? Will you have the courage not to stand aside and, in doing so, to make yourself dangerously different? Jennifer Lewin Kerr Huddersfield, West Yorkshire • Whenever I return to the country of my birth and walk through the parks and squares of London, generously endowed with statues and monuments to Britain’s glorious imperial past, I reflect how lucky Britain is that the millions of colonial subjects who were slaughtered in building the country’s empire perished in faraway places and not in the railway sidings, village squares and forests of England’s green and pleasant land. Nevertheless, the horror of that bloodstained past inevitably lurks close to the surface, the more so precisely because, in contrast to Germany’s past, it is still largely glossed over – and even glorified. So despite Barney Ronay’s disquiet at seeing Germany’s neatly parked bicycles, its staircases, corridors, suitcases and shoes, discarded or otherwise, I am glad to return to my adopted country. Stephen Richards Frankfurt, Germany • On my first visit to Germany, 14 years ago, my experience echoed that of Barney Ronay. But living here part of the year teaches me that those perceptions reflected what I brought with me from England. Atonement isn’t possible, but a careful dedication to ensuring the past doesn’t repeat itself prevails. Human rights are enshrined in the constitution. Every year, successive generations of teenagers clean the “stumbling stones” so that the names of the victims of fascism shine more clearly. Our town has recently updated a book about local victims of the Shoah. When their descendants make intended visits known, they are invited to be guests of the town, and treated with honour, respect and humility. Yes, there is a veer to the right and, yes, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has traction, but in recent months thousands have demonstrated against it in numerous cities. The right is in the ascendant in Britain, too, with less outcry. Modern Germany is flawed, it’s going through some difficult times. But perhaps its past leads it to strive harder to stay clear of the extremes threatening the west. Rebecca Bilkau Wolfenbüttel, Germany • I’ve been living and working in Germany for nearly 30 years and Barney Ronay is correct: some parts are thought-provoking – dark forests and railway sidings, for example. It’s these reminders that ensure that the concept of Nie wieder (“never again”) is firmly implanted in the national psyche. The AfD finds itself under considerable examination at the moment, both from the media and the parts of the state charged with ensuring that Nie wieder is more than just words. You can also see this on the streets: Germans of all religions, including Muslims and Jews, standing shoulder to shoulder under the banner of Nie wieder ist jetzt – “never again is now”.

        "Auteur": "Tumaini Carayol at Flushing Meadows",
        "Date": "2024-08-31",
        "Texte": "Coco Gauff arrived in New York this month carrying significant unwanted baggage. Although her summer had not started badly at all, it had descended into disappointment with a slew of dispiriting losses in significant tournaments. In stark contrast to her circumstances last year, when she capped off the best run of her life with her first grand slam title, the American returned to the US Open still searching for her best. In front of a rocking crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Gauff took a positive step forward as she drew on her resilience and problem-solving abilities after a testing start, recovering from a set down to reach the fourth round with a strong 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Elina Svitolina. “It means a lot. I knew today was gonna be a tough match, every time, Elina she’s a fighter,” said Gauff. “I knew I had to bring my best tennis, I thought I played well. I served much better than last match except the last service game but overall I was proud of what I was able to do.” While she had eased to this stage with two efficient performances, this match was always going to be the first real test of Gauff’s level and her readiness to mount a strong title defence. Svitolina has built a great career out of her defence, consistency and grit. Her base level is reliably high, meaning it usually takes a quality performance to defeat her. Since returning to the tour after giving birth to her daughter, Skai, Svitolina, 30 in September, has tried to play more offensive tennis instead of relying on her consistency and the hope that her opponents will miss. She stepped out here looking to take the initiative, dictating most exchanges by injecting pace into both groundstrokes, especially with her forehand, and constantly looking to break down the Gauff forehand. Although the American served well early on, she gradually lost her way. The Ukrainian continued to take the ball early and put her under significant pressure and Gauff particularly struggled with her trusty backhand. Down a break point at 2-2 in the set, she was on the verge of crisis. Even as the match seemed to be slipping from her grasp, the 20-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, remained composed and she confidently navigated the most important moments. Gauff saved the break point by forcing herself inside the baseline, eliciting a backhand error from Svitolina with a forceful inside-out forehand, before closing out an excellent hold. Surviving that difficult game provided the world No 3 with the impetus she had been searching for all afternoon. She produced a spectacular return game to break serve in the next game, firing four winners in total, including two forehands, and then she never looked back. From 2-2, break point down in the second set, Gauff won nine of the next 11 games before closing out an important victory. The manner that Gauff found a way through was particularly encouraging for her hopes of another deep run. Her defence, physicality and her ability to win when she is not playing well are all qualities that have allowed her to keep rising at a young age, but she knows that she also needs to take the initiative herself. In the decisive moments here, it was important that she served well and had the confidence and quality to step inside the baseline and attack off both groundstrokes. Less than an hour after Gauff had celebrated her win with fist pumps and a jubilant roar, she was back on the practice courts working hard on fortifying her backhand, one eye already on the next challenge. “I’m just trying to go out here and have fun,” Gauff told Sky Sports. “I know from winning one that just from the fourth round it’s still so far, a long way to go. “I’m just focused on the match in front of me and just enjoying it. I wrote in my journal: ‘I don’t want to leave with any regrets.’ Regardless of the results, I was just trying to give myself the best opportunity to win.” Gauff will next face her fast-rising compatriot Emma Navarro, the 13th seed, who defeated her in the last 16 of Wimbledon last month. Navarro reached the fourth round in New York with a similarly tough 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over Marta Kostyuk, the 19th seed. Elsewhere, Zheng Qinwen, the Olympic champion and seventh seed, continued her run by easing past Jule Niemeier 6-2, 6-1."

        "Texte": "Nick Cave refuses to be drawn into polarities, a quality lacking in many current discourses (Nick Cave on love, art and the loss of his sons: ‘It’s against nature to bury your children’, 28 March). It is encouraging to see a cultural figure take this position; it requires both courage and wisdom to do so. Cave reminds me of a Blakean figure grappling with the complexities of love, loss, spirituality and materialism. He is aware of some of his own vulnerabilities – and rather that disavow them, has faced and accepted them, which is reminiscent of Jung’s work. We can all grow through loss, and Cave is certainly no stranger to it. I hope he continues to use his creativity to encourage others to aspire to be as thoughtful and humble as he is becoming. Hugh Palmer Pocklington, East Yorkshire • Nick Cave is a gentle and kind soul. So I understand where he’s coming from when he says “There’s a lack of mercy, a lack of forgiveness” when it comes to being “woke”. But for all that, the human condition is as it is. Meek little lambs get eaten by big, nasty lions, and no amount of reasoned debate or giving horrible people a platform will stop that. It is a harsh lesson, and one it is best not to learn in the first place. But it is true. Indeed, sometimes, forgiveness is the worst kind of violence. I wish Cave all the love and healing in the world, but I fear for a world where those principles prevail. There are too many lions.

        "Titre": "Learning about personal space is a hard lesson for my affectionate son",
        "Auteur": "Séamas O’Reilly",
        "Date": "2024-09-01",
        "Texte": "My son is extremely, perhaps miraculously, affectionate toward his sister. We avoided the landmines of sibling rivalry and brotherly contempt we’d seen in so many of our friends’ second or third kids – primarily, we think, because the four-year age gap between them negated any sense that he was in direct competition with this cute little pet we’d just ordered. He immediately embraced his baby sister as a novelty; a sometimes loud, smelly doll that captivated him and, better yet, earned him brownie points any time he was nice to it. Within days of her being born, he was telling everyone she was ‘his’ baby, and would make a grand performance of fetching her things and patting her on the head. Though we largely took this to be performative, it became clear that his affection was in earnest when he started waking her in the night to stroke her face and ‘make sure she was all right’. Two years on, he’s still affectionate at six, but her own responses as a toddler have become more mixed. She rejects any hug he gives her and pushes at his legs when he sits too close. He’s hurt by this, which we find hard. Much of parenting, I now realise, is spent recognising your own neuroses as they stare back at you, half-formed, or attempting to resist the urge to ‘fix’ them for your own child, as if you’ve been granted a time machine. We try to tell him about personal space and remind him that some people don’t want to be hugged all the time. You should ask, we say. But this advice seems ill-suited for those times he does nothing more than walk into a room, prompting her to cross the entire floor on her doughy little legs so she can stick out a gummy hand and push him away. It’s hard, after all, to preach personal space when she goes out of her way to get him out of her way. Most of the time, we’re able to brush it off as a joke, another reflection of her, shall we say, aloof demeanour. Her resting toddler face is a stiff-lipped glower, her cheeks puffed out with studied contempt. My son has an altogether sunnier disposition. He and I are affectionate animals. Dogs, not cats. I’ve often presumed my own need for affection is rooted in growing up as one of 11 children in an attention-starved single-parent household, wrapped up in maternal bereavement and all that other cheery stuff you love to read about in this gently humorous weekly column. Now, however, I’m not so sure, since none of that applies to him, so maybe we’re just like that. Or perhaps I’ve just passed my own emotional faults down to him and stuck him with all my stupid baggage as a freebie. In the end, I can’t change the way he feels about this any more than I can turn her from a cat to a dog, nor should I want to. So, when my son seems hurt, I just tell him she’ll probably come round in the end. ‘When?’ he asks. Oh, for a time machine. Follow Séamas on X @shockproofbeats"

        "Titre": "Private Rites by Julia Armfield review – in deep water",
        "Auteur": "Lara Feigel",
        "Date": "2024-06-20",
        "Texte": "Do individual losses still matter in a world in its final stages? This is the question asked by Agnes, Isla and Irene, three queer, volatile daughters who congregate uneasily to view the corpse of their divisive, megalomaniac architect father Stephen Carmichael, while the rain pours down outside – as it has poured down for several years. Carmichael is both a contributor to this state of affairs – his gleaming masterpieces defied the early signs of climate crisis – and a saviour for the rich. His own house, which he now gifts provocatively to his youngest daughter alone, is a modernist folly-cum-masterpiece built high on ingeniously floating pylons. This rainy city, where people live makeshift lives on the top floors of flooded tower blocks, travelling by ferry, is natural territory for Julia Armfield. She is both poet and prophet of the watery and the queer and the channels connecting them. Her vision of the sea creature in all of us – scales hidden under skin – is as seductive as the charged, casually incandescent sentences she conjures it in. She is writing in an honourable tradition: throughout literary history there are watery women destined to find and to lose themselves in the depths of the sea, whether that’s Edna drowning in Kate Chopin’s The Awakening, or Ellen accepting her destiny as a mermaid in Rose Macaulay’s And No Man’s Wit. Armfield has given this trope new political urgency, first in 2022’s Our Wives Under the Sea, featuring a hushed-up submarine disaster, and now in this all-too-convincing imagining of the next phase in the climate crisis. Private Rites is so compelling partly because both the narrator and the protagonists feel intensely drawn to this watery world, even as they know it signals their end. Carmichael’s youngest daughter, Agnes, is a swimmer by temperament. She takes refuge in the shadowy thoughts she has while lane swimming breast stroke, glad that her mind can flick “blandly from songs she used to listen to, to actors who died, to dinner, to the fact that Dylan Thomas, when young, looked like literally every ugly boyfriend of every straight friend she’s ever had”, and glad that here she’s “less liable to come upon a thought that will cause her to scream and to never stop screaming”. Sometimes, her brain thus buoyed, she has brief sexual encounters with women in the changing room. A childhood spent cowering from the father who regularly hit her and left her to cry alone until she wet herself has left her fearful of more vulnerable forms of intimacy. Then she unexpectedly falls in love, opening herself to an efflorescence of tenderness of the kind Armfield writes so well, as her lover Stephanie leads her to an obsolete swimming pool on the rooftop of a makeshift nightclub. Stephanie opens up the pool cover to allow the rainwater in, and Agnes discovers the pleasures of a drenched, obliterating kind of sex, “the two of them moving in tandem, floating and drowning, fixed somewhere between”. The novel is an overt take on King Lear. Like Lear, Carmichael divided part of his estate between his daughters before his death, and if in his case this was malicious and tyrannical, it brings out the latent tyranny within Lear’s gesture. Shakespeare, too, depicts a realm where the “little world of man” strives vainly “to out-scorn / The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain”; the play is still one of the most powerful reckonings of our powerlessness before the climate that we have, made back in the days when the climate wasn’t something we’d created. Armfield’s daughterly take on Shakespeare is brilliantly audacious. Repeatedly, Agnes and her older, bossier sisters, Isla and Irene, try to come together, only to slip into habitual competitiveness. “It is,” Isla finds, “just so easy to allow herself the fun of resenting Agnes, as easy as it was when they were kids.” At the heart of this are absent mothers. Isla and Irene’s mother drowned herself after being ground down by their father; before her death, she had been replaced by Agnes’s mother, who disappeared shortly after her daughter’s birth. The sisters endlessly seek out forms of mothering, only to reject them, and offer themselves as maternal figures, only to withdraw. There’s a mystery charging through the book, signalled in the cryptic opening scene where a woman gashes a bloody cut in another woman’s mouth in a cultish ritual. Gradually this emerges as a memory from Irene’s childhood. The book ends with a revelation about this that takes the form of a scene in the kind of horror film that Armfield has alluded to throughout. I found this brutal and jarring – all the more so because she writes it so grippingly. Having committed to the intricacy of these women’s feelings, it’s frustrating and disorienting suddenly to find ourselves in another kind of story altogether. This seems to be the point: Armfield is always committed to experiments with genre and here she rips away realism, suggesting the old novelistic forms are as inadequate now as the half‑hearted forms of political protest that take place in the background. This isn’t what we’re left with, however. Something slower, starker and gentler emerges in the final pages. The great strength of Private Rites is that it never commits to an apocalyptic vision, even as the world it depicts becomes cartoonishly apocalyptic. In the final, astonishingly moving pages, the narrator affirms her commitment to dailiness in life and in art. “Better to hold one’s hands to whatever warmth there is, to kiss and talk and grieve and fuck and hold tight against the whitening of the sky.” Is it possible both to be responsible in the face of the largest challenges and to honour the tiny possibilities for grace in love? Armfield stages this dilemma with great vitality. There’s no new order, as in Lear; it’s too late for the kind of responsibility that might fend off apocalypse. But here, too, the survivors have discovered love with new clarity and force, and small forms of weathered, personal redemption remain grimly possible. • Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

        "Titre": "Deep-sea diver and fossil fan: meet Manchester United’s new No 1 keeper",
        "Auteur": "Tom Garry",
        "Date": "2024-09-19",
        "Texte": "We expect goalkeepers to be good at diving. How about at 130ft below the surface of the ocean? That’s the depth Manchester United’s Phallon Tullis-Joyce is certified to plunge to, after studying marine science and biology at the University of Miami and continuing with her passion for the underwater world around the shores of the UK on her days off since her 2023 summer transfer to the Women’s Super League. The 27-year-old’s prominence at Manchester United is poised to reach new heights as she embarks on a season where she is set to be the starting goalkeeper after Mary Earps’ summer switch to Paris Saint-Germain, and Tullis-Joyce should make her long-awaited English league debut against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday. Her love for the environment and for 100-million-year-old fossils is just as strong as her thirst for clean sheets. “When you’re in kindergarten, they always ask: ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’” she says. “My little card said: ‘I want to be a marine biologist,’ and I was obsessed with soccer from the start and obsessed with marine biology from the start. I always knew that those were my paths. “Immediately when I got here [in 2023], I went straight up to Oban in Scotland. That was the first dive centre that I joined, and then I’ve also been to Anglesey. I found out that that’s where the sea birds nest, and they also have great scuba diving there, too; the sea cliffs are gorgeous. You guys have some gorgeous natural marvels, just crazy things I haven’t seen before. I saw my first cuttlefish, so honestly, props to you guys! That’s really cool. “I am deep-diving certified. I did max that out [130ft] in Belize at the Blue Hole, an ancient cavern system, where I was hoping to see some sharks – we didn’t, but that was some great scuba diving. I was just recently diving in Norway as well. I’ve been around.” Equally enthused by palaeontology, Tullis-Joyce can also often be found fossil collecting in Yorkshire, spending hours “trying to find some ammonites”, or at sites of palaeontological interest along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall. “I’m a big Mary Anning [the renowned 19th-century English fossil collector] fan. I’m just really geeked out about the history that you have here.” Her other heroes include the American oceanographer Sylvia Earle, of whom she says: “I had the opportunity to meet her in high school and found out her nickname is ‘Her Deepness’. She’s also just such an ambassador for the ocean and the environment and has some great quotes like: ‘No blue, no green. No water, no life.’ She’s just a massive advocate for our environment.” When Tullis-Joyce retires from football, hopefully far in the future, she intends to return to academia and pursue a doctorate in marine ecology and marine protected areas. For now, her primary focus is trying to bring success to United. In her first year at the club, she was an unused substitute for all 22 WSL games and all five ties in the triumphant Women’s FA Cup run. However, she did play in their four League Cup fixtures, keeping two clean sheets. The New York-born, 6ft player is ready to take on extra responsibility this season. “Everyone knows the club and the pressure and expectations that come with that,” says Tullis-Joyce, who worked under the new Leicester manager, Amandine Miquel, when winning the French second tier with Reims. “That has been explained to me from the very start. I’ve been prepared. It’s up to me now, but I have been very well prepared by the coaching staff, and Willco [goalkeeper coach Ian Willcock] is an incredible goalkeeper trainer.” Tullis-Joyce has significant experience as a No 1 in a top league, not least in the 2022 American NWSL season when she was ever-present for the Seattle-based OL Reign, helping a side including Megan Rapinoe, Rose Lavelle and Jess Fishlock finish top of the regular-season table. That is a league position United would love to compete for, after last term’s fifth-placed finish. Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandberg are among the summer signings and Tullis-Joyce senses the team have a fresh energy. “We’ve seen their personalities right away. They made themselves known, like: ‘This is me, this is who I am, this is what I can bring to the team.’ We’re coming into this [season] as a new, young group, and we just want to approach the field with our own style, our own personality … My personal goal for this season is just to really let my personality show on the field and let my work ethic be a nice foundation for my teammates to know that I’m right there behind them, no matter what happens on the field. Any types of mistakes, I’m right there for them to clean it up.”"

        "Titre": "How millions of US children would be hurt by Trump’s mass deportation plan: ‘Deep harm is intentional’",
        "Auteur": "Robin Buller",
        "Date": "2024-11-22",
        "Texte": "Donald Trump confirmed on Monday his intentions to make mass deportations a hallmark of his second term. That such measures would drastically upend the lives of the US’s immigrant communities is widely understood. But sweeping anti-immigrant policies would also be detrimental to American citizens – most notably the nearly 20 million US-born children of immigrant parents. “Mass deportations will be profoundly harmful to US citizen children,” said Andrew Craycroft, staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco. In 2022, one in four US children had at least one immigrant parent, and more than 4 million US citizens under age 18 lived with an undocumented parent. “These are millions of US citizen children who were born here, who have grown up going to your elementary schools and playing on your little league baseball teams, who are facing a very real danger of losing their parents,” said Kelly Albinak Kribs, co-director of the Technical Assistance Program at the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights. And while the mechanics by which the president-elect would actually execute his sweeping anti-immigrant agenda remain murky, there is little doubt that creating a climate of fear for immigrant communities is one of his administration’s top priorities – and one that will cause irreparable psychological damage to millions of US citizens. *** Deporting the parents of US-citizen children didn’t begin with Trump. However, past administrations took precautions to limit the trauma it caused, advocates and legal experts say. The Obama administration barred Ice raids from taking place in schools, childcare centers, hospitals and places of worship. Before that, the Bush administration required Ice to notify schools and child protective services in advance of a large-scale raid. Trump’s policies, on the other hand, appear to traumatize children by design to curb unwanted immigration. “Under Trump, previously and in the future, deep harm to children is absolutely intentional and in many ways is the entire point,” said Wendy Cervantes, director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border separated at least 5,000 foreign-born children and hundreds of US citizen children from their parents. He also ramped-up interior enforcement measures, such as targeted worksite raids. In 2019, Cervantes visited towns in central Mississippi where Ice agents had arrested nearly 700 undocumented poultry plant workers, many of whom had US-born children attending nearby public schools. “The kids could see their parents being marched into white vans, handcuffed, as they were leaving school,” Cervantes said. “It was like a nightmare. And those kids, to this day, are still requiring a lot of mental health support.” Come January, Americans should anticipate a return to “draconian measures” such as family separation, said Kribs. Trump has also indicated desires to go after immigrants with legal status, expand the circumstances that allow for denaturalization and pursue unlawful measures that explicitly target the US-born children of immigrants like ending birthright citizenship. But how Trump would execute his more radical ambitions, including militarized mass deportations, is unclear. Such an operation would take a high degree of coordination, both between US agencies and with foreign governments, to pull off. A country like Mexico may accommodate receiving a few hundred people, “but it’s a completely different issue to talk about hundreds of thousands of people being sent back”, said Nando Sigona, professor of international migration and forced displacement at the University of Birmingham. It would also be expensive. According to Debu Gandhi, senior director for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, deporting workers would accelerate inflation, shrink the food supply, slow efforts to build affordable housing and squander taxpayer dollars in efforts to “deport mothers of US citizen children who [pose] no security threat”, Gandhi said. And then there’s the question of public opinion. Backlash again Trump’s 2018 family separation policies was widespread across the political spectrum, explained Lee Gelernt, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who led the lawsuit against “zero tolerance”. “If a second Trump administration does extreme things, we hope and expect the public will push back,” he said. “In his first term, I think they believed they had dehumanized the immigrant population to such an extent that the public would not push back even when little babies were torn away, but there was enormous pushback across the political and ideological spectrum.” *** Whether or not mass deportations occur, citizen children of immigrants will be adversely impacted by living in a constant state of fear. Research shows that the threat of parental separation alone can cause PTSD and toxic stress in young children. Under the coming administration, that stress will be especially pronounced in mixed-status families, where one or more parent lacks legal status. “It’s easiest to start with people who are wholly unprotected,” said Kribs. Anti-immigrant policies can also have a chilling effect by which immigrant parents, fearing arrest and separation, keep their citizen children home from school, refrain from signing up for benefits such as food stamps or health insurance, and avoid taking their citizen children to the doctor, said Sigona. Misinformation exacerbates immigrant parents’ fears that engaging with public services could jeopardize their status or their chances of acquiring permanent residency. The repercussions can be dangerous. “There were parents telling us about how they were making decisions about whether or not to take their kids to the emergency room in the middle of the night,” Cervantes said. Other citizen children may lose contact with the US entirely. If a parent facing deportation chooses to keep their family together, a citizen child will have to leave the US and resettle elsewhere – often in an unfamiliar country that their parent fled for reasons of safety or security. Existing guidance urges Ice agents to detain the parents of citizen children near their children’s residence, arrange for visitation rights, and give them time to make childcare arrangements – but this isn’t binding. “Broadly speaking, these citizen children don’t have the right to have their parent remain with them,” Craycroft said. “Children simply don’t have the same rights as adults,” echoed Cervantes, describing the discrepancy as one of the immigrant system’s biggest flaws. Knowing this, immigrant and child welfare advocates are prepared to have all hands on deck to combat what they see as an imminent crisis for millions of citizen children. “We are facing these next four years clear-eyed and ready to meet the challenge,” said the Young Center’s Kribs. “But there’s going to be a lot of heartbreak along the way.”"

        "Titre": "How I learned to navigate in the Welsh mountains",
        "Auteur": "Andy Pietrasik",
        "Date": "2025-01-04",
        "Texte": "Maps can be cumbersome things. Especially when it’s windy. They can be pretty confounding even when the elements are in your favour. But we’ll come to that. We were on a hill – not the technical term – in Snowdonia (Eryri national park), attempting to find first a path, then a boundary line, and then a spur of land – at night-time. Each member of our group was equipped with a map, a compass and a head torch. The wind was high, the sun was down and it could have all felt like an uphill slog. But it was, in fact, exhilarating. The last time I did this, and the last time I felt this energised by the elements and shadowy surroundings, I was 11 years old and yomping about with the Scouts. Back then, I would have been in the rump of the group, while an older and more responsible boy was entrusted with the map and compass to lead our little troop across craggy terrain. Ever since, I’ve always managed to buddy up with a more technically gifted walker able to read the runes. But I’ve never lost the topography of envy, and the slight sense of unease about striking out alone or straying too far from waymarked paths. Which is why I find myself sitting in a classroom with five other learners on a two-day navigation course at Plas y Brenin, the national outdoor centre, in Capel Curig. The first thing we are told by our instructor, Grace, is that the contour is the king. “Other things on the map, such as boundaries, buildings, woods and paths, can change, but contours are less likely to.” These reddish-brown lines spaced at regular intervals paint a two-dimensional picture of the landscape around us and tell us whether it’s flat (widely spaced contours), undulating (round) or steep (close together). They tell you which way is up (the numbers on every fifth contour will be legible) and which is down (numbers will be upside down). There’s lots more to take in besides: map scaling, setting the map to north with a compass, spotting ring contours and re-entrants, calculating height and distance. But you can only learn so much in the classroom, so we head out into the hills happy to follow contours as our king. The first recce lifted us out of the rain in Capel Curig and up into the blue-skied hills above Conwy Bay, where we started out on the Wales Coast Path before peeling off to learn how to set the map by the features we can see around us. We measure distances using the scale on the compass and pacing – counting how many paces it takes us to walk 100 metres. On high ground, we set a compass bearing and learn how to follow it by keeping the compass needle in line with the north arrow (red on red). We take back bearings to stay on course and estimate how long it takes to hike a route, including going up hill, using Naismith’s Rule. All the while, Grace sets us new paths to map and teaches us to find evidence in the landscape to determine whether we have arrived or strayed off course. The reason for this concentration on plotting a course over short distances becomes clear when Grace drives us into the hills at night. Weather conditions can change quickly and dramatically in the mountains, and it’s vital to be able to navigate in poor visibility. Night-time is disorientating enough, playing tricks with scale and distance, but with all the skills we’ve learned, we manage to find our way safely back to the van. And that’s the beauty of learning to navigate – it turns disorientation into discovery. The two-day Complete Navigation Skills course at Plas y Brenin takes place once a month throughout 2025, £258 for non-residents and £398 for residents including meals"

        "Titre": "How learning about the science of shyness helped me",
        "Auteur": "David Robson",
        "Date": "2024-06-02",
        "Texte": "On the day I received an offer from my first-choice university, I expected to feel elation and excitement. I had spent years preparing for this moment, and yet when it came, I felt only dread at the thought of freshers’ week and all the social challenges this would inevitably involve. I had always been something of a shrinking violet and the fact that I now had a close group of friends at school did not helped to assuagemy social anxiety. I assumed this was a stroke of extreme good luck – a one-off. The potential for rejection seemed immense, and I feared I would spend the next few years in loneliness. I was wrong: I soon made new friends. Yet my shyness lingered as I embarked on my career in journalism – a bizarre choice, I admit, for someone who felt nervous meeting strangers and loathed the idea of networking. I found ways to deal with those challenges, but it was only within the past few years that I began to truly relish the chance to meet new people. If only I had known then what I know now, my path might have been so much easier. As a science writer, I’ve witnessed a wealth of new research that has identified the psychological barriers that prevent us from building better relationships. Fortunately, my deep dive into the academic literature has also identified practical ways to build social confidence. Consider a phenomenon known as the liking gap, which describes our tendency to underestimate how much others have enjoyed our company and wish to build a stronger connection with us. In a series of experiments, psychologists asked two strangers to meet and chat and then questioned each party about their expectations and perceptions of the conversation. Before speaking, both assumed that the exchange would feel uncomfortable – yet they ended up enjoying it far more than they had believed they would. Over countless trials in all kinds of contexts, most people found it far easier to talk to strangers than they had initially feared. If only that pleasure was combined with self-confidence. After a conversation, most people assume they liked the other person more than the other person liked them. Or framed another way: neither party realise quite how appealing they have been and they don’t have faith the other person would be interested in building on that rapport with a future friendship. The liking gap can linger for months. One study asked university roommates to report on their perceptions of each other during their first year of living together. On average, it took each student about nine months for them to overcome their self-doubt and correctly appreciate how much the other person liked them. When I first learned about this research, I couldn’t help but cringe at all the times I had been afflicted by the liking gap. After meeting charming, funny and kind people, whom I wanted to get to know better, I would doubt that this was reciprocated. As a result, I would avoid any further contact for fear that I might seem embarrassingly needy. I would even turn down party invitations from people who I genuinely appreciated and admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness. Digging into the scientific literature, I soon found examples of many other misplaced fears that stand in the way of deeper and more meaningful relationships. Many of us are too shy about giving compliments or expressing our gratitude for other’s actions, for instance. We assume that they already know how great they are and we doubt our abilities to express those compliments elegantly. We imagine our gestures will seem ham-fisted and gauche. Those worries are largely unjustified. Most people are perfectly capable of distinguishing genuine praise from flattery and we consistently underestimate how much joy our words will bring. Provided that we display sensitivity and common sense, then our genuine appreciation will be welcomed for what it is – a small act of kindness. Expressing appreciation of others not only brings joy to the person receiving the praise but also to the person saying it; most people feel much better for having spoken their warm feelings. Unfortunately, our natural reserve means that most of us miss out on these opportunities to cement our bonds. We have similarly misplaced intuitions about self-disclosure – we tend to hold back our intimate thoughts and feelings and instead engage in superficial small talk when people tend to be far more interested in our inner life than we’d expect. This is a shame since that knowledge would be the foundation for a deeper relationship. And when we need help, we believe that people will resent us for our requests, when scientific research shows that they can enhance closeness, by proving our regard for the other person. Whether we regularly feel lonely, fear walking into a party full of strangers, or wish to get along better with our colleagues, most of us could do with a bit more faith in our social skills. Based on my own experiences and the research I have read, I believe this is imperative for anyone who wishes to live well. Feeling socially connected not only brings great joy, it also soothes our stress responses, thereby reducing our risk of many different illnesses – from the common cold to cardiac arrest. The results from more than 100 studies all show that social connection is as important for our health as diet or exercise. Greater connection can also enhance our creativity. The more nodes we have in our social network, the more exposed we will be to fresh ideas and new sources of inspiration. I have found that simply learning about concepts such as the liking gap can help us conquer our shyness, but it also needs perseverance if the effects are to last. As you will have found when learning any skill, greater confidence comes with regular practice outside our usual comfort zones. For me, an ambition to speak Italian gave me the necessary push. As my fluency in the language increased, I started arranging “conversation exchanges” with native speakers who wished to practise their English. Needless to say, I made many blunders, but I was touched to see how sensitively my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment and how easy it was to build a friendship despite the language barrier. Striking up new conversations in my native language suddenly felt a lot less daunting. You don’t need to go to this extreme. One study took the form of a week-long “scavenger hunt” that encouraged participants to set daily goals to approach and talk to strangers. They could decide to find someone with interesting shoes or eye-catching hair and then chat with them for a few minutes. Day by day, the participants came to recognise the pleasures of being more sociable and were less anxious about the possibility of rejection. We may still need strategies to help offset self-doubt when it kicks in. One tool that I use is “defocusing”, which involves making a conscious effort to look at the big picture instead of getting hung up on small details. If we think we have made a faux pas, we can remind ourselves of the many other things that we exchanged during the conversation; the other person’s impression of us is unlikely to hinge on a single clumsy comment, which will probably be forgotten. We might also remind ourselves of previous instances in which we’ve instantly jumped to the worst conclusion, but later found our fears were not proven. One of the best things you can do to overcome your shyness is to treat yourself with greater compassion. Many of us believe that self-criticism is essential if we are to behave better in the future, but the scientific literature suggests the very opposite is true. Beating ourselves up over a potential embarrassment only adds to our stress and reduces our capacity to learn from the perceived mistake. A simple exercise is to imagine that you are encouraging a friend or family member who is facing the same challenge or feeling the same worries; you might even write it down in the form as a letter. Once you have expressed those sentiments, you may find it far easier to be kinder to yourself. At the height of my shyness, it would have seemed inconceivable that I would write a book about social connection – let alone support it with public talks and media interviews. I don’t regret those years of anxiety; when considering the past, my overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude to all the people who proved my fears of rejection to be false. But I do wish that I could go back in time and tell my 18-year-old self about what I had learned. With just a little bit of encouragement and practice, we all have enormous potential to connect.

        "Titre": "‘I’ve had a wild, chaotic, beautiful life’: Rebecca Hall on race, regrets and learning to be herself",
        "Auteur": "Eva Wiseman",
        "Date": "2024-11-17",
        "Texte": "We all thought that we knew Rebecca Hall – English rose, on stage since childhood, daughter of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s founder Sir Peter Hall, regularly described in Hollywood as one of the best actors of her generation. But in 2021 she took what she calls now “a big swing” and suddenly the whole story cracked in half. The big swing was her directorial debut, Passing, a film about two women of colour, one of whom is “passing” for white; Hall had been working on the story for 15 years, but thinking about it for far longer. Her maternal grandfather, a doorman from Detroit, passed as white, as did Hall’s mother the opera singer Maria Ewing, whose experience of growing up with internalised racism contributed to mental health issues that Hall had to navigate throughout her childhood. Her parents split when she was young and her mother brought her up alone in a grand country house in Sussex. But very little parenting was done – Hall (later head girl at school, later a Cambridge drop-out) was her mother’s caretaker. Because, “that kind of hiding [from who you are] leads to a certain amount of chaos. I think it’s safe to say that that stuff gets passed on. And I definitely grew up in an environment where my mother didn’t see me. She wanted me to be a certain kind of thing.” Making Passing and then, perhaps even more, talking about the film, “changed me profoundly”, says Hall today, generous but watchful, drinking coffee in a hotel bar overlooking the Thames. “My public-facing world was stuck in some sort of performance of English rose, theatre actor, posh, privileged… Which is true, but also, not actually my experience. I was always confused by that, but I didn’t really know how to present my actual shape to the world. So I was, ‘It’s OK, I’ll just carry on doing what I love quietly,’ and I’ll pretend to be whatever they want me to be.” Since the film, she’s insisted on a kind of clarity. She wants to be precise about the Grey Gardens complexity to her seemingly privileged upbringing; she wants not just to act, but also direct and write and paint. She wants to say, turning brightly to face me: “I’m more than what you think I am.” This is what her typical day looks like: she’ll wake beside her husband, actor Morgan Spector, in their house in Upstate New York. They used to live in Manhattan, where she would walk their old cat on a lead. “It would be like walking down the street with Madonna,” she cackles with light grief. After breakfast, she’ll drive their six-year-old daughter, Ida, to school and then take the dog for a walk that will end up at her studio, where she’ll paint until she has to stop. At which point she will write until she “burns out”, then return to her easel. “I find acting completely fulfilling when the camera’s rolling, but then, the rest of the time, I get frustrated by it. Whereas painting… Oh I could do that all day long, every day.” And her paintings are great – sort of neo-expressionist, emotional, alive. Recently she’s been painting audiences – they smile and gasp from the canvas in purples and green. Why audiences? “Well I’ve spent an entire career, a pretty long one actually…” 42 now, she made her screen debut aged 10 in The Camomile Lawn, a series directed by her father, and was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2008 for Woody Allen’s Vicky Cristina Barcelona… “An entire career doing things for people to look at and I realised that, every time, I have something of a relationship with those people. It feels like an active ignoring.” The hotel fire-alarm test slices through our conversation and we wait, eyebrows raised. We’re meeting to talk about The Listeners, a haunting new BBC drama directed by Janicza Bravo, in which Hall plays a teacher who, one day, starts to hear a low, unidentifiable hum. When her family starts to doubt her sanity (could it be anxiety? Could it be, one doctor suggests, menopause?), the story slips into a gripping exploration of why ordinary people search for answers in dark places. Hall has, Bravo tells me, “harnessed both the approachable and the enigmatic. She feels like someone you know, want to know. She’s striking, which makes her delectable to watch, of course.” When the alarm stops, leaving in its wake a silent ringing, Hall continues: “It almost felt to me like I was exhaling when I first read the script,” she smiles, “because I was like, ah, someone’s daring to make something that feels really about this moment, a time when reality is pretty fragile, actually.” As particular as her character’s story appears, “it feels like an experience we’re all having on some level. There’s a certain amount of desperation and we’re all going crazy, individually and collectively!” Ha! we say uneasily. Ha. This unstable character sits comfortably on a timeline of Hall’s recent roles, like in Christine, the true story of a news reporter who died by suicide live on air. “Yes, I suppose all the people I play have a mask, and a reality that’s behind the mask, and there is this tension between trying to define the middle ground.” She hasn’t consciously chosen to spend time exclusively inside women on the edge and breaks them up with starring roles in noisy blockbusters, like this year’s Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. “But it’s just sort of happened along the way. Someone, actually, accused me of being ‘The queen of the gaslight narrative.’” Were they correct? “Well, I don’t like being told I’m anything, ever,” Hall laughs. In 2018, after Woody Allen’s daughter, Dylan Farrow, expressed anger that Hollywood continued to support her father, despite her allegations he’d sexually assaulted her as a child, Hall made a statement saying she saw “that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed” and was “profoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today.” She also pledged her salary from her recent project with Allen to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. How does she feel about that today? “I struggle with this one,” she says, twisting her body into a series of crosses. “It’s very unlike me to make a public statement about anything. I make the stuff, that’s how I am political. I don’t think of myself as an ‘actor-vist’, I’m not that person. And, I kind of regret making that statement, because I don’t think it’s the responsibility of his actors to speak to that situation.” She was in a peculiar state, she tells me – newly pregnant, deeply affected emotionally by Farrow’s allegations and, at the time, working on A Rainy Day in New York, directed by Allen. One morning, “I was outside, shooting a street scene with Jude Law where, literally, my dialogue was, ‘You’ve got to stop sleeping with these fucking 15-year-olds.’ And that day, the Weinstein scandal breaks. There’s a bank of journalists and paparazzi right there, because Weinstein’s a producer on it, and they’re all listening to me say this.” Every interview that followed revolved around Allen and Weinstein, “and I was in a tangle. Like, in this moment, it’s the most important thing to believe the women. Yes, of course, there’s going to be complications and nuances in these stories, but we’re redressing a balance here. So I felt like I wanted to do something definitive.” That’s when she made the statement, trying to articulate her discomfort, but remain balanced. “But it just became, ‘another person denounces Woody Allen and regrets working with him’, which is not what I said actually. I don’t regret working with him. He gave me a great job opportunity and he was kind to me.” Beyond that? “I have no idea. I don’t talk to him any more, but I don’t think that we should be the ones who are doing judge and jury on this.” How would she respond if it were to happen now? “I wouldn’t say anything – my policy actually is to be an artist. Don’t come out and state your stuff so much. I don’t think that makes me apathetic or not engaged. I just think it’s my job.” And it’s a busy job, a rich job – she’s just wrapped on a film with Jamie Lee Curtis, and a biopic about the photographer Peter Hujar with Ben Whishaw, but she makes time for pleasure, too, which for Hall means reality TV. “Morgan doesn’t understand it – he’s like, ‘I thought I married this sophisticated, cultured, literate, artistic type?’ But I just find it utterly fascinating. It’s such a good way to look at human behaviour, in performance, which obviously is my interest.” She leans in as she talks about the magic and artistry of Real Housewives and its sister shows, all these people “trying really hard to be themselves” and “the little blips when it breaks down, the raw desperation”, the way, “social constructs get remounted in these weird microcosms where they’re even more crazily hetero-normative or insanely gendered”. Delayed on a plane recently she watched eight hours of Vanderpump Rules (“Profound!”), and now plans to watch it again, backwards. Another project she’s working on is her second film, Four Days Like Sunday, loosely based on her relationship with her mother and the cast of queer and beautiful characters who raised her. Her mother died at the beginning of 2022 – that summer Hall wrote the script. Not long ago Hall came across her mother’s Desert Island Discs, from the early 90s. “It was shocking to hear her voice – she was in this patch where she spoke in a very serious English accent. And in the interview she talks about her dad being Black. I was like, are you kidding me? Because she would never talk about it to me.” When Passing was greenlit, Hall called to tell her. Her mother hung up. The next day she phoned back. “You’re really going to make a movie of that?” Hall quotes, in a low Detroit accent, but it cracks slightly as she continues, “and it actually breaks my heart to tell this story, but she did say, ‘I don’t know if that’s a good idea, Rebecca. It could be dangerous’.” She pauses. “‘Look at you, you’re white’, is what she said.” She felt her childhood flash before her: “Silly stuff. Like, I’d come back from holiday and she’d be like, ‘you’ve got too tan’. It would be loaded, there was something else there. And lots of, ‘don’t wear your hair like this, don’t swear’, I mean, it was all controlled around her particular internalised, racist idea of what blackness was, you know? The reality of going on this journey is that you realise it’s all, obviously, a bloody construct. We’re all performing something – and this was such a big piece of my childhood.” And yet, when the film came out, it turned out to be a “profound release for my mother”. Some of her relatives in Detroit, Republicans, born-again Christians, have thanked her, too, “but I could tell that it was a complicated gratitude”. One reason she lives in New York is because it’s fairly equidistant between her family in the UK and Spector’s in California. They’ve been together for nine years and have acted opposite each other four times. Once she told a newspaper that the greatest achievement of her life was getting married. Does she stand by that? “For me, the idea of marriage was anathema. I was politically opposed to it, fundamentally opposed to it. And I think I didn’t believe in the possibility of monogamy either – I had no example of it growing up. It was just divorces everywhere and lonely people. So it probably is the greatest thing I have achieved in the sense that I managed to get to a place where it seemed a completely rational choice.” She had come to a realisation that it was possible for Spector and her to define what marriage might be. “Which makes it this completely wonderful and hopeful thing. The idea you can get to a place where you’re like, ‘I choose to believe in the impossibility of things’. It’s the most hopeful thing you can do, isn’t it? And insane in a world where it’s difficult to find places for that. So I love it, actually. I’m shocked by how much that kind of stability and anchor has actually allowed me to… fly.” Similarly, she had decided from a young age that she didn’t want children. “Having been brought up by very preoccupied and brilliant artistic types, I couldn’t imagine a world where I, a preoccupied artistic type, could be a good parent. But I married someone who is so committed to making up for whatever deficit I might have and allowing me to be that, but also making sure I’m present for my child and holding it all together. I got lucky.” As she’s talking, I’m remembering an exquisite monologue about motherhood towards the end of The Listeners. “I used to look at my mother and wonder, why aren’t you happy?” it goes. “I used to think, you made a decision to live a small life. And I will never let that happen to me.” It resonated with Hall, despite the fact that, “my life has never been little,” she says. “I’ve had a lot of life already, and it’s been extreme. I understand that fear, though, because I’ve had a wild and chaotic and beautiful life. And I’ve been frightened of doing something that might limit it. Because I’ve grappled forever, in the way that people who are raised by a narcissistic personality type do, with the idea I might be silenced in some way.” Hall was forever working not to overshadow her mother, but also to satisfy her need to live vicariously through her daughter, an impossible balance. Now though, “I think I’m more rooted in myself. I had a tendency to hide.” In what way? “When I was young, my choices were all about: how can I be as invisible as possible while also being the biggest star in the world?” She laughs darkly. When she and Spector decided, finally, to get married, she found herself becoming fixated on the idea that people plan their fantasy weddings and the more precise the plan, the more likely it is they will be disappointed. “And I was like, can we manufacture some circumstances where we have no idea what’s going to happen, so that we can just experience it?” They came up with the idea of, “bring your own wedding, like bring your own bottle? We’re just going to gather in a house and we’re going to eat and drink and dance and have fun. And if at any point anyone wants to marry us,” if anybody wants to perform a ceremony, “please do.” One friend, artist Rob Roth, leapt out of the shrubbery dressed as a werewolf and sang, ‘If a double-decker bus / crashes into us…’ Another, the actor Dan Stevens, called everybody out to the pond as a blood moon was rising and gave them a candle to hold. “He was like, ‘OK, this is my thing,’ and he made Morgan and I stand way up, high over there, while everyone else was on the other side of the water, and said, ‘I just want you to have an experience of seeing us, your community.’” We both sit for a moment, grinning stupidly. “It was about saying, ‘This is our world, these are our people and we will define ourselves exactly how we want to’.” The Listeners will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 9pm on Tuesday 19 November Styling by Bailey Moon at Brigade Talent; hair by Ben Skervin using ColorWow at Walter Schupfer Management; makeup by Sam Addington at Kramer + Kramer"

        "Titre": "Westminster coroner’s court extension review – an extension of deep sympathy",
        "Auteur": "Rowan Moore",
        "Date": "2024-06-30",
        "Texte": "Westminster coroner’s court is a pretty, playful building from 1893 by the little-known architect GRW Wheeler, red brick with stone trimmings, pertly symmetrical, its style sort of Jacobean. “It’s a bit Beatrix Potter,” says the architect of its new extension, Patrick Lynch. The mood of the original building doesn’t say much about the sombre activities it was built to contain: the identification of bodies, the examination of deaths felt to be in need of explanation, the matter-of-fact delivery of conclusions on causes and circumstances. Its aim seems to be comfort, its message “never mind”. Lynch’s stone-faced, timber-framed extension looks, at first sight, as different as can be. It presents, next to the old building’s busy-ness, a smooth, blank, round-ended elevation, which is the gable end of a barrel-vaulted oblong block. The shapes might make you think of tombstones and sarcophagi; the new building looks more ancient than the older one. It is, in a good way, odd: its gravity sets up a relationship with its neighbour that is not going to be entirely easy. The idea, though, is to be complementary rather than antagonistic, not to pick a fight between different eras of architecture, but to create an assembly of objects and spaces – old and new, internal and external, serious and sweet – that contribute as much as construction materials can to the dignity and comfort of the bereaved. Lynch is an architect who likes to reflect on the meanings and human significance of his art. His largest commissions to date are office and apartment buildings in Victoria, close to the court, including a just finished block called n2, and his approach helps him bring unexpected richness to these types of development. The court is an occasion to create a “secular-sacred atmosphere of civic seriousness and compassion”.For the artist Brian Clarke, whose ceramics and stained glass are an integral part of the project, this is a chance to put into practice his belief that “architecture’s responsibility is to increase the value of human life”. Both Clarke and Lynch have been through what the former calls the “brutally grim” experiences of coroners’ courts, following the deaths of loved ones, and both are moved to do what they can to improve them. As well as fulfilling the same duties as coroner’s courts all over the country, the one in Westminster has a particular responsibility to examine cases in London of national significance. The inquests into the Grenfell Tower disaster and the terrorist attacks on Westminster Bridge, both in 2017, were held here. The main functions of the extension are a jury room, which can also be used as a second courtroom, offices, and a waiting room for families. The existing building has been renovated and reformed. In the aftermath of Grenfell, a Garden of Remembrance was built quickly to Lynch’s designs, to provide a reflective space for those affected. A new Garden of Reflection, accessible through the waiting room, will open alongside the rest of the remade court. The first sessions will be held there in September. Inside, the building is both solemn and intimate. The new court/jury room is almost churchy beneath its hemi-cylindrical vault, with coloured light from Clarke’s glass entering from the western side. The atmosphere is inward-looking and removed from the life of the street: the glass is opaque where it needs to be, to stop passers-by or photographers’ lenses intruding on the privacy of proceedings, becoming more transparent higher up, so as to give views of the sky. At the same time, Lynch takes some cues from the more thoughtful elements of the older building, especially a central bay window with a built-in seat – “An act of empathy,” he says, “a place to sit and cry.” His work likewise offers what he calls “welcoming, body-scaled furniture” built into the fabric. There is plenty of timber, especially oak, which feels both civic and friendly. Even in the building’s most monumental moments the scale remains small. Taken altogether, the complex crams in a lot. Spaces can be both off-centre and symmetrical, long or high, light or dark. If there is something Roman about the new stone block, the wandering plan of the composite old-new interior is more like an old English country house. The gardens are something else again, geometric affairs of circles and squares in light and dark masonry, with subtle variations in their roughness and smoothness, spectrally lit at night. If the sarcophagus-like extension seems determined to impose some sort of will on the site, other elements are diffuse to the point of dissolution, only to be brought back to coherence through the consistent intent behind them, and through echoes and rhymes of shapes. The semi-circle motif pops up in various guises – as gable, old bay window, a niche in the Garden of Remembrance. The horizontal striations of the old building are continued, in less pronounced form, in the courses of the stonework on the new extension. And then there are Clarke’s windows, donated by him to the building, that appear at significant moments around the complex. They represent spring flowers with deep primaries, with some offbeat green and pink, painted and then etched on to the glass with what he calls “urgency”. It’s a simple but effective idea, realised with virtuosity in the handling of depth and density of colour, meant to convey growth and renewal. The role of his work, he says, is “not to give people an artistic ecstasy, but to say ‘I am with you’, ‘I know what you’re going through’, to put an arm around people’s shoulders”. Building and glass together might conceivably verge on the mawkish, if they weren’t delivered with both palpable wholehearted good intent and high levels of skill and subtlety. There might also be something overly self-important about the more sepulchral aspects of the architecture, except its oddness stops it being too pompous. Also, helpfully, the ensemble of old and new together encompasses a wide range of lightness and weight. Beatrix Potter meets ancient Rome is, it turns out, a rewarding combination."

        "Titre": "High court blocks Cumbria plan for UK’s first new deep coalmine in 30 years",
        "Auteur": "Helena Horton",
        "Date": "2024-09-13",
        "Texte": "The UK’s first new deep coalmine in 30 years will not be allowed to go ahead after a ruling in the high court. On Friday morning, Justice Holgate ruled that plans to build the facility in Whitehaven, Cumbria, would not proceed, in what campaigners called a “victory for the environment”. New fossil fuel projects are thought to be on shakier legal ground after the precedent set by a landmark supreme court decision that quashed planning permission granted for an oil drilling well at Horse Hill on the Weald in Surrey. The judgment found the climate impact of burning coal, oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects. This was the first court decision on plans for a new fossil fuel development since the Horse Hill ruling. Holgate agreed with Friends of the Earth that Michael Gove, when he was secretary of state for levelling up, acted unlawfully in accepting a claim by West Cumbria Mining (WCM) that the mine would be “net zero” and have no impact on the country’s ability to meet the emissions cuts required under the Climate Change Act 2008, because it was relying on offsetting through purchasing carbon credits from abroad. UK government policy does not allow for reliance on international offsets to meet carbon budgets. The new Labour government this year withdrew its support from the Whitehaven mine in the Cumbria legal case. Lawyers acting for Angela Rayner, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, said there had been an “error in law” in the decision to grant planning permission for the mine in December 2022. Withdrawing its defence against two legal challenges by Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Action on Climate Change, the government instead informed the court that the planning permission should be quashed. The case proceeded as the developer of the mine, WCM, still wanted to defend the original decision to approve it. Emissions from the burning of the coal from the proposed Whitehaven mine were not included in the developer’s climate assessment. The mine’s total lifetime emissions, to come almost entirely from the burning of the coal, were forecast to exceed 220m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, an amount equal to more than half of the UK’s total emissions in 2022. During the hearing, lawyers acting for Friends of the Earth said that given the decision by the supreme court in the Surrey case, the climate impact of burning coal, oil and gas should have been taken into account when deciding whether to approve the project. “WCM … failed to quantify or assess the downstream combustion emissions from the coal extracted from the mine,” they submitted. Niall Toru, a senior lawyer at Friends of the Earth, said: “This is fantastic news and a huge victory for our environment and everyone who has fought against this climate-damaging and completely unnecessary coalmine. It is the first fossil fuel case to be decided after the landmark Supreme Court judgment on oil drilling at Horse Hill. That the ruling today has gone against the mining company could have ramifications internationally, as there are cases abroad where challenges are being made against fossil fuel projects on a very similar basis. “This mine should never have been given permission in the first place. The case against it is overwhelming: it would have huge climate impacts, its coal isn’t needed and it harms the UK’s international reputation on climate.” The ruling means Rayner will now have to reconsider the planning application – taking into account its full climate impact. In doing this, she could call for new evidence, reopen the planning inquiry, or the mining company could redraft and resubmit an application. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said: “Coalmining belongs in the past, so hopefully this is the last we’ll hear of it. The UK government now needs to ensure communities right across country aren’t left with choice of high-carbon jobs or no jobs.” West Cumbria Mining declined to comment on the decision. The headline and body text of this article were updated on 13 September 2024 to clarify that the Cumbria development would have been the UK’s first new deep coalmine, rather than its first new coalmine of any kind, in 30 years."

        "Titre": "Once I would have squirmed if a barista knew my order. But I’m learning to love being a regular | Emma Beddington",
        "Auteur": "Emma Beddington",
        "Date": "2024-12-08",
        "Texte": "We went to the same cafe almost every day during our month-long trip to Venice. It was the same one as on my last trip, its windows stuffed full of dry-looking biscuits, slices of Barbie-pink nougat and souvenir tins with Rialto views, while pigeons milled around the door as if daring each other to enter. Inside, there was a display case of pastries, a shelf of never-touched aperitifs and an overworked coffee machine behind a high counter. It’s always packed: pensioners, dog walkers, office workers, the postwoman, dithering tourists and the bravest pigeons, cruising for crumbs. I recognised the staff though obviously they didn’t recognise me, what with 2.1 million tourists trudging past every year. But gradually we infiltrated the morning ecosystem and, after 10 days, the tall guy who operated the machine started saying: “Normale e lungo?” when we reached the front of the coffee crush. In week three, one particularly busy morning, he caught my eye as I queued and gesticulated at our already-made coffees, waiting on the counter. Cutting through to claim them, I felt like, I don’t know, George Clooney? Or at least a pigeon with recognisable markings that they don’t bother kicking out. It was a special moment: the gift of a brief sense of belonging. It made me consider my feelings about the “being a regular” experience back home, which are historically ambivalent. I crave connection in my life of solitary screen staring, and brief chats when I visit my habitual haunts usually feel like bright, tiny gifts. Research shows that weak ties – our bonds with the people we see and interact with minimally – make us happier. But there are days when everything in my life is a bin fire, I’m spotty, unshowered and sulky; when I need cake but can’t face pleasantries. Other times, there’s nothing even wrong – I’m just inhabited by a mutinous, slightly adolescent, desire not to be known. There was a lovely piece in the New York Times last year about becoming a regular as an antidote to loneliness, but one line about the author’s ice-cream parlour hang-out froze my blood: “He tossed his broom aside and sat down across from me to ask what I was writing.” Argh! Flee! It’s not that I believe a few minutes’ boring chat with me is any kind of prize to bestow or withhold. It’s more that I sometimes get a panicky sense that both parties are becoming tangled in an inescapable web of social obligation. I don’t think I’m alone in occasionally experiencing a sort of vertigo when weak ties threaten to become stronger. Isn’t there a very British urban horror story about a familiar stranger you’ve exchanged nods with for years on your commute one day striking up a conversation, which means you then have to get up an hour earlier to avoid them? We move to big cities to keep our ties weaker than water, to reinvent ourselves without anyone saying: “Oh, you drink macchiatos now?” or: “You’re looking nice today!” The fact that 50 pubs a month closed in the first half of this year in England and Wales suggests there are fewer of us in the market for a place where everybody knows your name. But I think, gradually, I’m shedding my ambivalence. Moving back to my home town was a sort of acceptance of the mixed blessing of being known, because you’re a regular everywhere if you live somewhere small enough. Being here has helped me appreciate frequent connection more – the joy of places where everyone knows your order, at least. Yes, that means also accepting being known as utterly predictable, cake-dependent, often inarticulate and unwashed, and having the odd chat when you’re least in the mood for one. But I’ve started to understand that being caught – held, actually – in a web of inescapable social obligation is life. In Venice, it was me who tried to strengthen the weak tie: on my birthday, I announced I was “cinquanta oggi” (50 today) and the cafe staff congratulated me with polite bafflement, then ignored me entirely. For the rest of the trip they talked to me about nothing but coffee and payment, because I’m not really a regular there. But I am here, and that’s rather nice. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist"

        "Titre": "The big picture: Consuelo Kanaga’s portrait of a young woman in the deep south, 1948",
        "Auteur": "Tim Adams",
        "Date": "2024-09-29",
        "Texte": "Consuelo Kanaga took this picture of a young woman in Tennessee in 1948. Kanaga had by that time been working as a professional photographer for 33 years, having got her first job at the San Francisco Chronicle at the age of 21. She was a pioneer in portraiture of Black Americans, through the era of Jim Crow and into the civil rights movement, chronicling the Harlem Renaissance and the painfully slow loosening of segregation in the south. This image is included in a new retrospective book of Kanaga’s work. The portrait of the young woman is typical of Kanaga’s handling of light; a gentleness learned living with families in the projects of San Francisco in the previous decade. The framing offers a visual reference to the art of silhouette, reserved for mostly elite – and white – profiles before the advent of photography. Kanaga presents a simple profile, but her eye dwells on the light and shade of her subject’s interiority with all the painterly care of an old master. The headband and the frilled collar and the eyes fixed – hopefully? resignedly? – toward an uncertain future post-second world war add to the effect. “Young is old in poor cultures,” Kanaga once said. The photographer lived to be 83, and saw some of those hopes for a fairer society fulfilled. Her best known image, She Is a Tree of Life to Them, a picture of a mother and her two young sons, became one of the defining photographs of Edward Steichen’s celebrated Family of Man exhibition in 1955. Kanaga died in 1978, leaving behind an archive of only about 2,500 negatives and 375 gelatin silver prints. Recent years have seen her reclaimed as a transcendent artist: “If I could make one true, quiet photograph,” she said, “I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.” • Consuelo Kanaga is published by Thames &amp; Hudson (£50).

        "Titre": "GDP growth is strong but it masks UK plc’s deep-seated structural problems | Larry Elliott",
        "Auteur": "Larry Elliott",
        "Date": "2024-08-18",
        "Texte": "Britain had the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first half of this year. The unemployment rate is coming down and so is wage inflation. As Jim Callaghan never quite said as he arrived back in the country during the winter of discontent: crisis? What crisis? Last week’s release of key economic indicators were not exactly supportive of the government’s argument that it was handed a country in worse shape than at any time since 1945. That’s quite a claim when quarterly growth is running at 0.6%, the annual inflation rate is 2.2% and unemployment is 4.2%. Jeremy Hunt, the caretaker shadow chancellor, is making sure the government’s argument doesn’t go unanswered – which makes political sense for the Conservatives. When George Osborne made similar claims in 2010, Labour was too busy with a leadership contest to rebut them, with the result that they came to be accepted as fact, which they certainly weren’t. That said, this is not a case of boom-boom Britain either. Far from it, in fact. Ruth Gregory, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, puts it this way: Overall, we are sceptical of talk that the UK is now experiencing ‘Goldilocks’ conditions. But it’s clear that there has been a shift in the narrative away from weak growth and high inflation, towards stronger growth and weaker inflation.” That sums up the position pretty well. Things were getting better in the first half of 2024 (from a low base) and there is no harm in Labour admitting it. Voters kicked the Tories out not because of the state of the economy but because of their record over 14 years. They will cut Rachel Reeves some slack in October’s budget, even if she raises taxes, just as they did when Gordon Brown kept to the tough spending plans he inherited from Kenneth Clarke in 1997. But Reeves needs to deploy the right argument. Her case should be that the Tories failed to tackle Britain’s longstanding productivity, investment and trade deficits and that Labour can. There is plenty of evidence to support that case. Dig a bit deeper into last week’s figures and it is clear the Tories handed over an economy where the structural problems were as deep – and in some cases even more acute – than they were in 2010. Let’s start by unpicking the growth figures, where the 0.6% increase in activity in the second quarter was entirely due to a strong performance in the services sector. Manufacturing and construction both contracted. Although services make up about 80% of the economy, growth was unbalanced. Britain has a poor record for business investment and – despite Hunt’s generous tax breaks – there is not much evidence that companies are responding to a more benign economic backdrop with more capital expenditure. Business investment was down by 0.1% on the quarter and by 1.1% over the past year. What’s more, gross domestic product (GDP) is a poor gauge of how a country is doing. Even those who take it seriously as a measure would say that what matters is not GDP but GDP per head, and here the UK’s recent record is distinctly unimpressive. Per capita GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2024 but is more than 2% lower than it was before the start of the pandemic. The fact that people in Britain are poorer than they were in 2020 has been masked by population growth. The latest labour market figures show that the number of employees on payrolls rose by more than 250,000 over the past year but the UK’s productivity performance has continued to be poor. Output an hour worked was 0.1% lower in the second quarter than a year earlier and is just over 2% higher than it was before the onset of the pandemic. It doesn’t take a genius to draw the connection between weak investment, weak productivity and weak growth in per-capita incomes. A breakdown of the labour market figures by region provides evidence of a north-south divide. The employment rate across the whole of the UK is 74.5%. However, the rate is above average in the south of England, at just above 78%, whereas in Wales it is almost 10 points lower, at 68.9%. Scotland (73.4%), Northern Ireland (71.6%), the north-east (69%), the West Midlands (72.7%) and the north-west (73.1%) all have employment rates below the national average. Parts of the UK that have traditionally been more dependent on manufacturing have markedly lower employment rates than services-heavy regions. So it should come as no surprise that the latest trade figures for the second quarter of 2024 show that the UK ran a massive £52.4bn deficit in goods, which was only partly offset by a £39.1bn surplus in services. Once again, it is easy enough to join the dots. Manufacturing’s share of the economy has been steadily falling for decades, with the result that the UK has not run a trade surplus in goods since the early 1980s. By contrast, the UK is second only to the US as an exporter of services, and the firms responsible for those exports – the banks, the management consultants, the architects – tend to be located in the south-east. Put simply, the economy is going through a cyclical upswing, underpinned by the fact that wages are rising faster than prices and amid hopes that interest rates have further to fall. That doesn’t mean all the economy’s problems have miraculously been solved, because that is obviously not the case. There are still structural challenges. Yet Labour is doing itself no favours by exaggerating how bad things currently are. It should tell it as it is."

        "Titre": "Learning to scoot is all very well, but what’s the point if you can’t ring your own bell? | Séamas O’Reilly",
        "Auteur": "Séamas O’Reilly",
        "Date": "2024-11-17",
        "Texte": "Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats. We’re in our local park, giving her – and us – a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we’d avoid the mess we made of her brother’s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we’ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn’t insist, due to the fact we weren’t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we’re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness. Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids’ scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism. Part of me thinks he’s just doubling down on; that he can’t possibly enjoy stretching and sweating while his friends sail effortlessly beside him. But, if that is the case and it is all an act, I can’t help but admire him more. He may not have the resilience of his sister when it comes to scooting, but his stubbornness is a marvel. From his place on terra firma, he’s whispering encouragement in her ear. She’s back onboard and planning a tentative glide. He runs beside her as she finds her speed, a bright smile spreading across her face, and his. There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion and the joy of seeing her fears crushed like so many mulched leaves under bright pink plastic wheels. On the way back, she is scooting as if she’s been doing it for years, and with a cocksure swagger that suggests she occasionally gives demonstrations for cash. As we round the corner for home, we pass an older girl scooting towards us. She’s about four and clearly a local scooter pilot of great acclaim. As we pass, she gives our daughter a special acknowledgment, tapping her helmet and waving to signify that they are sisters of the board. Our girl can’t disguise her delight, and knowing not what else to say simply shouts: ‘Scooter!’ The other girl laughs and, as if to baptise our daughter officially into the sect, lets out a sparkling ding-ding-ding from the bell on her handlebars. We consider this, in small girl terms, roughly equivalent to a knighthood, and we turn to see how our little apprentice is taking it. She’s staring, dumbfounded at the gap between her hand and the handlebars where we never thought to place a bell, motioning futile presses with her thumb. ‘Where’s my ding-ding-ding?’ she says, very close to tears.

        "Titre": "Sutton house where fire killed four boys was 20cm deep in rubbish, court hears",
        "Auteur": "Sammy Gecsoyler",
        "Date": "2024-09-16",
        "Texte": "Four young boys living in a house strewn with rubbish and human excrement died hiding under a bed as their home went up in flames after their mother left them home alone to visit a supermarket, a court has heard. Deveca Rose, 29, is on trial for the manslaughter of her two sets of twins, Leyton and Logan Hoath, aged three, and Kyson and Bryson Hoath, aged four, and child cruelty. The four boys died after a fire was sparked at their home in Sutton, south London, on 16 December 2021. The boys are believed to have run upstairs and cried for help but were unable to escape the locked house and died under a bed, the Old Bailey was told. The children were known to social services but their case was closed three months before their deaths. The court was told the floors of their home were 20cm (8in) deep in rubbish. The prosecutor Kate Lumsdon KC said Rose left her children unattended to visit Sainsbury’s on the night of the blaze. “She either dropped a lit cigarette before she left or left tea lights burning, or both. A fire started on or under the sofa, and due to amount of rubbish in the house it took hold quickly,” Lumsdon said. “The children were, we suggest, locked in the house and could not escape. They ran upstairs to get away from the fire and shouted to the neighbours. But it was too late for anything to be done.” Jurors were told that while Rose ensured the children were well turned out, in reality they lived in “very poor conditions”. “The toilet and the bath were full of rubbish and could not be used. Buckets and pots were used as toilets instead,” Lumsdon said. Family members on the children’s father’s side had concerns, and their paternal grandmother had not visited the house often as Rose was “cagey” about letting her in, jurors were told. The children had not attended school for three weeks before the fire. At about 6.30pm on the day of the fire, Rose left her children unattended to visit Sainsbury’s. While she was away, neighbours realised the house was on fire and could hear the children inside. Lumsdon told jurors that firefighters “found the four boys under a bed in the upstairs front room. They were limp and unconscious. Firemen noted that there was rubbish all over the floor of the house and human excrement. There was a mattress and a door on the stairs.” Attempts to save the children were made on the pavement outside but they were pronounced dead in hospital. Rose claimed she had left the children with a woman called Jade, which prompted firefighters to go back into the house to search for her. But Lumsdon said there was no sign of the friend, and extensive inquiries had led to the “firm conclusion” that Jade either did not exist or played no part in the events of that evening. The court heard that Rose was probably depressed and may have a personality disorder, but the prosecutor said that was not a defence. Rose has denied the charges against her and the trial continues."

        "Titre": "New ghost shark species with unusually long nose discovered in deep seas off New Zealand",
        "Auteur": "Eva Corlett in Wellington",
        "Date": "2024-09-25",
        "Texte": "A new species of ghost shark, with an unusually long nose and a whip-like tail, has been discovered in the inky depths of New Zealand waters. Scientists at New Zealand’s National Institute for Water and Atmospherics (Niwa) initially believed the creature was part of an existing species found around the world, but further investigation revealed it was new, genetically distinct, species. The newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish is only found in New Zealand and Australian waters. Ghost sharks – also known as chimaeras and spookfish - are a group of cartilaginous fish closely related to sharks and rays. They have smooth skin, beak-like teeth and feed off crustaceans such as shrimp and molluscs. They are sometimes referred to as the ocean’s butterflies for the way they glide through the water with their large pectoral fins. The mysterious fish are typically found at great ocean depths – up to 2,600 metres - and little is known about their biology or the threats they face. “Ghost sharks are incredibly under-studied, there is a lot we don’t know about them,” said Dr Brit Finucci, a fisheries scientist at Niwa who helped discover the new species. “Chimaeras are quite cryptic in nature – they can be hard to find in the deep ocean … and they generally don’t get the same attention sharks do, when it comes to research.” The new ghost shark was found in the Chathams Rise, roughly 750km east of New Zealand’s coast. It is distinctive for its very elongated snout that can make up half of its entire body length and has likely evolved to aid its hunt for prey. The chocolate-brown fish can grow up to a metre long, has large milky-coloured eyes and a serrated dorsal fin to deter predators. Roughly 55 species of ghost shark have been discovered globally, with about 12 of those found in New Zealand and South Pacific waters. Scientists suspected it was a new species based off of its morphology – how it looks – but further genetic research was needed to confirm the theory. Discovering that it was indeed a distinct species was an exciting moment for Finucci. “It’s really neat to be able to contribute to science,” she said. “Understanding the animal itself can feed into further research and whether they need conservation management.” In a touching homage to her grandmother, Finucci gave the ghost shark the scientific name Harriotta avia: Harriotta being the genus name, and avia meaning grandmother in Latin. “I also liked the idea that … sharks and ghost sharks are the old, ancient, relatives of fish, and I was naming the animal after an ancient relative of mine.” • This article was amended on 27 September 2024. An earlier version said that the scientific name chosen was Harriotta avia because Harriotta was Dr Finucci’s grandmother’s name; in fact, it is the genus name."

        "Date": "2024-04-15",
        "Texte": "Re your article (How Spain and Ireland became the EU’s sharpest critics of Israel, 5 April), I fear you may have omitted one of the principal reasons why not only Ireland, but also the Netherlands, have come to have such sympathy for the Palestinians: the presence of the Irish and Dutch battalions in Unifil, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. In the late 1970s, at a time when public opinion in both Ireland and the Netherlands was overwhelmingly pro-Israeli, the direct exposure of both Irish and Dutch troops on the ground in south Lebanon to Israeli actions and attitudes prompted the soldiers to have very different views regarding Israel. I estimate that close to 30,000 individuals have now served with Irishbatt (Ireland’s blue berets) in south Lebanon, with many of them directly experiencing varying degrees of difficulty regarding Israeli actions. In the days when Irishbatt’s principal concern was tension between Israeli forces to the south of the Irishbatt positions in and around Tibnin and Palestinian fighters to the north (whereas now it is helping cool tensions between Israel and Hezbollah), I well remember when I was reporting from south Lebanon, one battalion commandant telling me: “We came here to face north, but we find ourselves facing south.” That was in 1978. At the time, an Israeli official, after spotting some soldiers digging a military emplacement in the sweltering heat, dismissed the Irish troops as “half-naked savages”. Perhaps the Irish troops, their families, their friends and also their political masters have not forgotten the insult. John Roberts Jedburgh, Scottish Borders"

        "Titre": "How I learned to paint in St Ives, Cornwall",
        "Auteur": "Wyl Menmuir",
        "Date": "2025-01-06",
        "Texte": "There was the briefest moment late on Sunday afternoon when, standing back from the easel, paintbrush in hand, I almost felt like an artist. What I had produced was by no means accomplished but I was beginning to see what it could become. It may sound like a modest achievement, but before signing up for a weekend Discover Painting course at St Ives School of Painting I had not put a brush to canvas since my GCSEs almost 30 years ago. Even at school I tried to avoid painting, so I knew the weekend would push me out of my comfort zone. The pre-course nerves were compounded by the setting. Aside from chronic over-tourism, which the small Cornish town suffers all summer, St Ives is best known for art. Peter Lanyon, Ben Nicholson, Patrick Heron and Wilhelmina Barns-Graham are among scores of notable painters associated with the town, now home to both the Tate’s westernmost outpost and a museum and sculpture garden dedicated to Barbara Hepworth. The School of Painting, set within the famed Porthmeor Studios, is a long-established part of that heritage – and all the painters mentioned above worked here at some point. It’s the dream artists’ studio: high ceilings, walls stacked with paints and palettes, and large, angled Atlantic-facing windows flooding the place with light. My nerves were clearly shared by the eight others on the course, a mix of men and women aged between about 30 and 60. As we introduced ourselves on Saturday morning, we each owned up to varying levels of ineptitude. In contrast, Ilker Cinarel, our artist tutor, was all confidence on our behalf. We were not there to create a finished piece, he said. We were there to play, and to learn about processes of painting. Our imagined masterpieces would have to wait. It was a sentiment he would come back to several times over the two days, whenever he noticed we were taking things too seriously. The school offers a range of courses – from oil painting to printmaking – for all levels. The Discover Painting course is described as “a fast track into painting from the heart” and in keeping with this we were at work – or, rather, play – quickly, at desks equipped with papers, paints and materials. We started small, knocking out pencil and charcoal sketches of a still life of pots. There was no time to wonder how bad our attempts were as, no sooner had we taped them to the walls, we were on to the next activity, mixing acrylic paints and creating colour palettes that ran from lightest yellows to forest greens, from deep reds to vibrant blues. Mixing paints was a complete change of pace, part of what Ilker described as “the Zen part of painting”, though by the afternoon we were back to painting rapidly, first with a variety of brushes and then creating different textures with palette knives, sponges, thin sticks and pieces of card. By the end of the first day, when I retired to The Quarterdeck, a one-bedroom apartment minutes from the studio, with views across St Ives harbour, I was tired enough to be glad I could order in a pizza. By the second day, after an early morning swim at Porthgwidden beach and breakfast at Porthmeor Beach Cafe, the atmosphere in the studio had shifted. We were loosening up as we broke out the easels and moved onto larger canvases, drawing together the various techniques we’d practised. My still life sketches started to morph into something more abstract, close-ups of two sections of pots now beginning to resemble two planets colliding, all swirling blues and greens. “You will fail and fail and fail,” Ilker told us cheerfully as he moved between the desks, offering small suggestions and encouragement. He pulled down a large art book from a shelf to show us the 40 or 50 attempts Henri Matisse had made before getting his painting of a reclining nude “right”. It was liberating to feel I didn’t have to be good at something for a whole weekend. A hush descended over the studio in the final two hours, contented concentration etched on our faces. Even if it was for just a few minutes, I suspect each of us forgot we had entered the studio on Saturday morning feeling we were frauds who had mistakenly been handed paintbrushes. Back home, I was even tempted to frame one of my attempts and hang it in my office. The three-day Discover Painting course at St Ives School of Painting is £395pp. Accommodation was provided by Aspects Holidays; three-night stays at The Quarterdeck from £466.50 Wyl Menmuir is the author of The Heart of The Woods (Aurum, £16.99), available at guardianbookshop.com for £15.29.

        "Auteur": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent",
        "Date": "2024-11-11",
        "Texte": "Nationals leader David Littleproud, shadow transport minister Bridget McKenzie and Senate Liberal leader Simon Birmingham have all rejected a backbench push to use Donald Trump’s election in the US to abandon support for net zero by 2050. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said he is completely committed to the target, attempting to fight the next election on the Coalition’s vague taxpayer-funded nuclear plan that will likely extend the use of coal and gas rather than the 2050 target. But after Trump’s win, several Nationals backbenchers suggested the policy should be reconsidered, with Senator Matt Canavan calling to withdraw from the Paris agreement and MP Keith Pitt praising Trump’s “bold positions” including on climate change. Asked if the Coalition should rethink its support for net zero, Littleproud told Sky News: “No.” He said: “And while President Trump’s made some soundings about that, you have got to understand your place in the world. “They are 330 million people, we’re 27 million people, we’re a trading nation. The only people that will hurt out of that will be our farmers and our mining sector.” Littleproud warned that attempting to “lead the world” out of the Paris agreement “will get a tariff whacked on our commodity”, in reference to carbon tariffs, such as the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Littleproud took aim at the Albanese government for its 2030 emissions reduction target, arguing that Australia could reach net zero by “[taking] our time to it and [doing] it properly, so that there isn’t an impact on the economy”. A consensus of scientists have repeatedly said delaying climate action is worsening catastrophic global heating, including the potential for decades-long megadroughts in Australia. Littleproud noted that he was “the first leader to be able to get the Coalition to agree to nuclear energy being part of that grid, to have that complement and supplement with gas and coal, with [carbon capture and storage] and having some renewables”, implicitly comparing himself with former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce. “We will have a balance, we’ll do it properly, we’ll do it sensibly. But I think we should just take a deep breath on trying to be Trump-esque here in Australia, because there are unintended consequences, and they are farmers and miners.” McKenzie said that “the Coalition is absolutely committed to net zero by 2050”. “In fact it is a fundamental pillar of our drive for net zero with nuclear, which will set us up for energy security into the next century,” she told Guardian Australia. “The National party has consistently raised issues with the method and aggressive rate of emission reduction and who pays for that … we’ve always said net zero would never be net zero cost, that our industries and our communities would be the most significantly impacted.” McKenzie specified that she was referring to targets set by state governments and the federal Labor government for 43% emissions reduction by 2030. She said this was impacting regional communities through the renewable rollout and resulting in “aggressive” EV targets. Birmingham, the opposition foreign affairs spokesperson and leader of moderate Liberals, said the Coalition’s position under Dutton “is solid in both the commitment to net zero and taking difficult decisions to get there, such as zero emissions nuclear technology”. Ahead of Trump’s election the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, noted earlier in November that the Albanese government and the Biden administration had been “closely aligned in policy and personal terms” and “obviously, having a United States administration with a very forward-leaning climate policy is a good thing”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Bowen suggested a second Trump administration would be unlikely to live up to the former president’s anti-climate rhetoric on the climate crisis."

        "Titre": "Rahm case casts shadow over Ryder Cup as PGA Tour-LIV rupture still runs deep | Ewan Murray",
        "Auteur": "Ewan Murray",
        "Date": "2024-09-16",
        "Texte": "Jon Rahm has made his second decision. Only time will tell if this proves more successful than his first. If not, Europe’s Ryder Cup scene is about to get messier than anybody could have expected. By his own admission, Rahm anticipated the pace of play towards collaboration in elite men’s golf to be considerably sharper than has proven the case. He probably even expected his switch to LIV last December to accelerate talks between Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and traditional tours. Instead, the sport remains in a state of flux. Each entity ploughs its own furrow. Last week, Rahm came within hours of forfeiting his Ryder Cup place on a point of principle. The Spaniard objects to the imposition of fines already worth hundreds of thousands of pounds by the DP World – formerly European – Tour for his involvement with LIV without requisite permission. To Rahm’s credit, he is unwilling for LIV to pay these penalties on his behalf. A Rahm appeal has allowed him to enter three upcoming European events, which in turn will allow him to fulfil his membership obligations for 2024, so keeping him in the mix for Bethpage and a Ryder Cup defence next September. For the time being, that is; Rahm remains adamant he will not pay the fines, which raises the question of what on earth will happen if he loses his appeal at some point, presumably in the first half of 2025? And the clear odds are that will happen, given a sporting arbitration panel judged in favour of the European Tour Group on this matter in April 2023. Two elements of this remain unsatisfactory. Golf’s fault line has always existed between the PGA Tour and the LIV circuit which has caused it all manner of problems, including by the pinching of star names. The DP World Tour has a strategic alliance with the PGA Tour which means it has to dance to the tune from Ponte Vedra Beach but we now have a scenario where the Ryder Cup, a totally separate entity, is affected. The DP World Tour has never been engaged in outright warfare with the Saudis. Indeed, speculation continues that the PIF could align with the Europeans, thus creating a worldwide challenge to the PGA Tour, if last year’s framework agreement withers on the vine. If the PGA Tour is serious about a properly collective approach, now 15 months on from preaching about that very thing, it should tell its European equivalent it can do what it likes with the Ryder Cup. The biennial joust should not be collateral damage in someone else’s row. The PGA Tour has no claims whatsoever on the Ryder Cup; unlike the Presidents Cup, which has remained a LIV-free zone despite the fact it is a competitive farce. The Ryder Cup is, however, hugely important to the DP World Tour and its finances. People may turn their nose up at Rahm and his LIV involvement; a stark reality is the Ryder Cup is harmed, including commercially, without his involvement. Regardless of what transpires over the next year Rahm – a star as the United States were vanquished in Rome – will be one of Europe’s leading dozen golfers. The second problem relates to the fines themselves. It is difficult to shake the notion these are elaborate ransom demands. “Pay us hundreds of thousands – a tiny percentage of your LIV income – and we will open the Ryder Cup door.” For a competition supposedly providing the purest form of sport, where a virtue is made of players not receiving a penny, this feels vulgar. It will suit the DP World Tour to sit behind rules, regulations and protecting the rights of their rank and file members but the fact the appeal option existed for Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton only demonstrates leeway exists where there is a proper will. Luke Donald, Europe’s captain, expressed frustration in recent days that men’s golf is not in a more advanced place. Donald is bright enough to foresee a nightmare scenario. If the Rahm fine situation blows up again far closer to Bethpage, Donald’s position will be an invidious one. Both Rahm and Donald are banking on this case being resolved, somehow in their favour, in short order. This presently feels a huge leap of faith."

Onami, who goes by a single name, is one of many parents – increasingly visible on social media, more unassuming offline – practicing a radical form of home teaching dubbed “unschooling”. Also known as “free schooling” or “self-directed learning”, it is an informal educational approach in which the direction is dictated by a child’s interests. It eschews curricula, testing (standardized or otherwise), homework, recess, other pupils and all the other hallmarks of conventional education. True believers regard it as a corrective to a flagging public school system, which leaves so many children behind. Critics, meanwhile, say that it’s little more than a form of educational neglect and abuse. As Onami soon learned, not everyone values such an outside-the-box approach to education. Her feed was deluged with withering comments: “This is how my son wrote at 3”; “this is quite behind for a six yr old”; “all the letters were backwards and upside down”; “you’re crippling your children”; “this isn’t ‘free’ learning or ‘unschooling’. It’s just neglect.” Others chimed in to make fun of her tattoos, which include the word “gentleness” inked in cursive on the upper perimeter of her forehead, just below the hairline. “What’s so interesting about all of these commenters,” Onami says from her home in New York’s Hudson valley, “is that nobody looked up what the average reading age is. The average age for reading in America is six and seven. People really wanted to throw my child – or really me – under the bus, but never even Googled the facts that they’re spitting out.” Onami is partially correct. The age six to seven benchmark is for something closer to literacy – with children being able to compose full sentences, even paragraphs – whereas those same standards state that children typically start writing letters by age four or five. She tells me that her three-year-old daughter, meanwhile, is progressing along with reading and writing closer to this pace. This is not a problem for an unschooling parent. Different children, the philosophy goes, demand different things. As an unschooling parent, Onami centers observation in her approach. She notes that while her son is more interested in hands-on learning, in the form of building and construction, her daughter showed an interest in reading and writing by age three. When her son showed an interest in cooking, she began asking questions of him, and herself: “What is it about the process they love? Is it the problem-solving? Is it messing things up? From this I’ve noticed his love of measuring, from which has come a love of math.” She describes this approach, which values play and self-discovery, as “very Montessori”. Unlike a traditional Montessori school, however, Onami removes anything resembling a traditional classroom. Her children’s education is demonstrably more robust and outdoorsy. When young Rainer is not appearing in her TikTok videos, Onami estimates that he spends up to 10 hours a day playing outside: damming creeks, constructing ad hoc aquariums, grafting plants in the family garden and availing himself of other earthly delights. Towards the end of an hour-long call, Onami’s son knocks on her door and asks if they can go outside to pick black raspberries. She immediately obliges. Unschooling believers claim the approach boasts benefits beyond education (or lack thereof). For Onami – who works mostly from home, as an entrepreneurial adviser, life coach and autoerotic sex magic guru – unschooling permits her more quality time with her children. Back to the old school It’s estimated that some 3.1 million American children are home schooled. Some research suggests that 12% of those are “unschooled”. (For reasons explored a little later, those numbers can be very tricky to precisely verify.) Prominent unschoolers have drawn more attention to the movement. Unschoolers claim the pop singer Billie Eilish, and her producer-slash-brother Finneas, as prominent success stories. (“I learned how to do math by cooking with my mom,” the singer has said.) Another multiple-Grammy winner, Alanis Morissette, has likewise spoken out as an unschooling parent. The Food Network star Ree Drummond, the Pioneer Woman herself, does not use the word “unschooling” but has spoken openly about her role as a “relaxed home schooler”, whose at-home education approach amounts to an “a la carte hodgepodge”. Elon Musk has also spoken in support of education models that reject traditional grading and standards in favor of a more unfettered approach to creativity. Unschooling has a long, somewhat fuzzy history. Because it possesses no real doctrine or dogma, it can be tricky to connect it to pre-existing modes of alternative education. However, some clear precedents and points of contact exist. There was the “open classroom” movement of the 1960s and 70s; the rise of “minimally invasive education” in the late 1990s; and the much older, and more explicitly politicized, idea of “voluntarism”, promoted by the 19th-century British individualist philosopher Auberon Herbert, which held that all state activities, including the education of children, should be non-mandatory and non-coercive. In the more modern context, this non-coercive approach was reconceived by John Holt, a non-accredited American educator whose newsletter, Growing Without Schooling (GWS), catalyzed the contemporary unschooling movement in the mid-70s. In essence, Holt believed that children would learn to read, write, do basic math and cultivate a range of other interests (academic and otherwise) of their own accord, and without explicit instruction. Peter Gray, a psychologist at Boston College, has emerged as another key figure, having written the book (or at least several widely read pamphlets) on unschooling. “I prefer to use the term ‘self-directed education’,” Gray says. “I’m talking about children taking charge of their education, which also involves determining what they’re learning.” The question that follows is how exactly does a child determine, or even know, what they’re interested in, absent any kind of initial instruction? For Gray, the answer is exposure. Presented with a range of stimuli (books, films, television programs and “free play”, of which Gray is a particularly strong proponent), the child’s interests will naturally present themselves, in time. Gray notes that the pace of learning also differs among children. Some self-directed students may not learn to read until their teenage years. “But they learn very quickly,” he notes. “They can become big readers, after that.” The fluidity of these timelines can raise some alarms. More conventional, school-bound literary milestones suggest that children should be reading independently by the second or third grade. A 2003 report from the US Department of Education stresses that, when it comes to reading, the sooner the better. “It is no exaggeration to say that how well children learn to read affects directly not only how successful they are in school but also how well they do throughout their lives,” it states. “When children learn to read, they have the key that opens the door to all the knowledge of the world.” For many unschoolers, traditional education (namely US public education) is simply not the best system for reaching those sorts of ideals. School’s out for ever Gregory Horlacher, 46, started thinking about alternative education while employed as a teacher. He was living and working in Baltimore, teaching high school to what he calls “quote-unquote at-risk kids”. He loved his students but struggled to apply that devotion within the structure of the school system. He researched alternative education methods. He made every effort to reach out to the students who needed it. But nothing seemed to take. “I came to think of myself as a prison guard,” he recalls. “I didn’t want my kid to go through what I see so many kids going through in the school system.” In time, Horlacher and his wife had a son of their own and began mulling alternative education options. They were in a unique position. His wife made enough money to support the family, meaning Horlacher was able to devote himself to being a stay-at-home-dad. “I was able to do that,” he says. “So we were able to try unschooling.” At home, Horlacher employs a technique called strewing, in which potential interests are presented to a child, in order to determine the direction of their learning. “We’re not just throwing our kids out in the wild and saying ‘good luck’,” he says. “When you see what your kid’s interests are, you leave stuff out for them, whether it’s a toy or a YouTube video, so you can see if their interest is piqued. So you’re sort of leading them on their own journey … well, not leading. Supporting that journey.” Another popular influencer in the #unschooling scene is Skyler DuPont, a 29-year-old “lifelong unschooler” with two degrees. “A mistake a lot of people make about unschooling is assuming that unschooling means absolutely never using metrics of formal education,” Dupont explains from their home in Anchorage, Alaska. “Unschooling is really all about using whatever a person wants to use, as long as they’re the one determining that that’s how they want to learn.” In their videos, DuPont habitually identifies as “a grown radical lifelong unschooler”. They answer questions from viewers, post “unschooling hot takes”, expound on their own experiences – being “unschooled” by two mothers who encouraged them to follow their “own educational interests” – and generally offer a highly informed, intelligent and overwhelmingly positive take on the philosophy, from the perspective of someone who actually experienced it. “I don’t like to think of myself as a success story,” they say. “There’s an idea in the unschooling world that there’s success, and not-success. That’s often measured from outside perspectives. Typically that means: ‘Did you go to college?’ Obviously I went to both undergrad and grad school. So that presents really well.” DuPont parlayed a decade-plus of unstructured, self-directed learning into the pursuit of an undergraduate degree at Hampshire College, a private liberal arts institution in western Massachusetts, and a master’s in social work from Columbia University. They recently accepted a job as the executive director of a non-profit in rural Alaska countering domestic violence. A peer-reviewed 2015 study co-authored by Gray of Boston College found that only 4% of unschoolers reported being unhappy with the experience. (Gray notes that the survey, of only 75 people, is somewhat self-selecting: that is, the people surveyed agreed to take part, and were inclined to report positively. It also didn’t account for unschoolers who drifted into conventional education between kindergarten and 12th grade.) However marginal, such negative experiences do undoubtedly exist. “My experience with unschooling can be boiled down to extreme inconsistency and moderate neglect,” says Tyler*, who agreed to share his experience on the condition of anonymity. “It places the responsibility of education on children, who don’t have the same psychological needs as adults. But the whole philosophy of unschooling is to ignore this fact and say that children should direct their own learning.” Unlike DuPont, Tyler had great difficulty adjusting to formal education. When he entered community college at age 16, his math and reading skills were only at a second grade-level, he said. It took him 12 years to complete a bachelor’s degree, which he attributes to all the remedial courses he had to enroll in merely to catch up to his peers. He also suffered significant neglect, educational and otherwise. For Tyler, and a number of others schooled (or unschooled) at home, unschooling can feel like little more than a fancy term for straight up not schooling. “It keeps children uneducated, and easily controlled,” he says. “They won’t speak out, or even have enough understanding to know they are being abused or neglected.” School of hard knocks Caitlin Davis, 36, was pulled out of school in southern Ontario, Canada, when she was in first grade. Her parents were evangelical Christians, who took their children out of school after their eldest daughter passed away from leukaemia. Initially, Caitlin’s mother made a run at something like conventional home schooling: setting up lesson plans, assigning schoolwork, even having an ad hoc classroom in the family basement. Before long, any semblance of normal schooling fell apart. When her mother returned to work, Caitlin and her younger sister were left more or less to their own devices, mostly spending time fiddling around on the family computer. In 1999, when she would have been in the sixth grade, Caitlin heard the news of the massacre at Columbine high school in Colorado. It stirred in her a strange feeling: not sadness, or horror, but something closer to longing. “I would have rather gone to school with the threat of a school shooter,” she recalls, bitterly. “I would have rather been shot in the face. That’s how bad it was … I think home schooling, unschooling, whatever you want to call it, is absolute child abuse.” Beyond the total dearth of formal education, which put Davis well behind her peers, she says she suffered most acutely from not really having any peers. Friendships were hard to come by. When she did connect with other children, and then teenagers, she found herself woefully out of step. She watched lots of movies and spent her days and nights surfing the internet, largely unsupervised. Her understanding of the high school experience was shaped entirely by pop culture. “To this day, I’ll ask people if stuff like school pictures, or school dances, really happen,” she recalls. “Like: ‘Is that actually a thing?’ It’s crazy.” In her adult life, Davis has settled into something like normalcy. She sees a therapist. She has a healthy relationship with her husband. She completed a college degree. After some work as an education assistant, she now works with children at a therapy center. But the feelings of alienation and abuse she suffered in a free-form, unsupervised educational environment are never far from her mind. Davis is not alone in her suffering, or her desire to process that childhood trauma. As information – and mere “content” – advocating for unschooling, free schooling and other self-directed educational philosophies spreads online, a countervailing movement has emerged, warning against the potential dangers of these movements. Beyond haranguing pop-ups in comment sections of videos by influencers like Onami or Skyler DuPont, communities have formed giving a voice to those who see themselves as “survivors” of unconventional education. Deep in such forums, a profound incredulity prevails. There is a sense that all forms of home schooling or self-directed education are de facto neglectful and abusive. Deeper still, there looms a form of vigilant paranoia, which rejects the idea that anyone could even conceivably emerge from such a setting physically and psychologically unscathed. When I tell one survivor that I’ve spoken with some grown, well-adjusted-seeming unschoolers, they insist that those people’s trauma has merely not yet manifested. “Responsible home-schooling families do exist,” says Angela Grimberg, executive director of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education. “But you have another group of people who take advantage of lax home-schooling policies across the country to isolate and abuse their children.” The coalition focuses on “empower[ing] children by educating the public and advocating for child-centered, evidence-based policy and practices for families and professionals”. A recent report by the group noted nearly 500 cases of abuse among home-schooled students in the US, with nearly 200 fatalities since the year 2000. A 2014 study found that nearly half of child torture victims in the US were home schooled. Grimberg notes that 11 states do not even require that parents notify school districts of intent to home school, which can lead to a total lack of accountability at the state level. Only one state, New York, mandates that children educated outside of traditional schools regularly come into contact with an adult outside the home, for the purposes of assessment. This is what makes it so difficult to even estimate the number of American home schoolers, let alone unschoolers. For many parents pursuing alternative, in-home educational philosophies, this lack of oversight is just fine. For others, it may be the point. A key value among many parents who pursue in-home, alternative modes of education is “parents’ rights”. These rights enshrine a parent’s ability to make decisions on behalf of their child, especially in regards to education. Such parents have their own non-profit groups that lobby (sometimes quite relentlessly) on their behalf. The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), for example, provides resources to home-schooling parents, ranging from tips for developing an at-home curriculum to an emergency number for parents confronted with pesky state social workers rapping at their doors. Michael Farris, a co-founder of the HSLDA, has even authored a kind of novel/manual called Anonymous Tip, telling the story of a home-schooling mother squaring off against an eager investigator dispatched by Child Protective Services. “The most shocking part of it all,” the back cover text claims, “it could really happen to anyone!” “They have a lot more money than us,” Grimberg says of the HSLDA. “Every time positive legislation that would protect children comes up in a state, the HSLDA gets their constituent to go and attack the capitol and make sure that bill doesn’t get passed. We’re constantly at odds with them. They’re working to deregulate states further.” Grimberg notes that the HSLDA has been particularly effective in normalizing the rhetoric of “parents’ rights”. Yet the focus on these particular rights marks a sharp distinction between more traditional forms of home schooling, and those fuzzier, more newfangled modes of self-directed learning. Historically, home schoolers across the country fit a fairly reliable profile: fundamentalist Christians whose politics tilt rather far to the right. They are typically distrustful of state and private institutions educating and rearing their children. One home-schooling survivor, 35-year-old Sarah*, was instructed in the tradition of Christian Reconstructionism, a Calvinist movement that holds that God’s law transcends that of the state. She says that she and her siblings suffered extreme physical and emotional abuse, resulting in lifelong struggles with PTSD. “I grew up being taught that my parents had the authority from God to maim or kill me if I wasn’t obedient enough,” Sarah says. “A lot of parents are using the guise of home schooling to exercise complete domination and totalitarian rule over their children’s lives. They scream freedom, but not freedom for children.” The more modern unschooling set rejects – or at least claims to reject – this domineering tendency. Gray describes many unschooling parents as “politically left-of-center, more than libertarian”. Onami describes many in the community as “crunchy, granola, hippie”. Gregory Horlacher, meanwhile, actually finds himself “wary” of other unschoolers. “I don’t like ‘granola’,” he says. “Sometimes it signals, you know, anti-vaxxers. I don’t want to be around that.” A school of thought What is shared among this diverse swath of practitioners is a genuine-seeming value of children’s autonomy. The idea (on paper, anyway) is to nurture and encourage a child’s emerging interest and preoccupations, not just to build more curious students but more well-rounded people. “You have a massive amount of self-determination, from a very young age,” says Skyler DuPont. “When you grow up with that kind of self-reflection and self-evaluation, it creates people who can do that as adults. It builds resilience. It builds self-confidence.” DuPont has watched the scene expand from the frontlines, as one of the lead organizers of the Northeast Unschooling Conference, an annual meeting of self-directed learners. This year’s conference featured a tie-dye workshop, an ice cream social, an online video creation seminar and a keynote address by Sawyer Fredericks, a songwriter and grown unschooler and winner of the NBC singing competition series The Voice. For DuPont, the explosion of unschooling content spreading on social media helps draw attention to the movement, further diversifying it. “There’s a much greater variety of voices in the unschooling world than there was even 10 years ago,” they note, “who are adapting the philosophy to work for their families, in all sorts of different ways.” For advocates like Angela Grimberg, the swelling social media ecosystem can seem like a bit of a distraction from more pressing issues facing the many children who are isolated, abused and otherwise unaccounted for. “We have so much work to do defending the basic rights of children,” she says. “We’re not on TikTok, looking at these influencers.” For the critics flooding the comment sections to cry foul about shoddy parenting, social media may well provide something that more conservative, orthodox, housebound home schoolers lack: not just an outlet for their outrage, but a form of shared, highly public, livestreamed oversight. Still, many survivors of unschooling, and home schooling, aren’t buying it. The projection of normalcy, and even success, has long been part of the home-schooling toolkit. “This is exactly how my mother was back in the 90s,” says Tyler. “For her, it was touring support groups and conferences and whatnot, to brag about how happy, well-adjusted and educated her children were, while neglecting to mention the suicide attempts, running away, screaming and tears that permeated daily life.” *This article uses pseudonyms to protect the identities of home-schooled sources who requested anonymity."

        "Titre": "How I learned to fly-fish on the banks of the Thames",
        "Auteur": "Tracy McVeigh",
        "Date": "2025-01-05",
        "Texte": "Fishing has been one of those things, like pottery classes, or going on a yoga retreat in Ibiza, that I’ve never tried but envied from afar. People doing those things look calm, focused. The very things a hobby should bring. They don’t look like people whose minds are fraught with deadlines, meetings and calls, and an inbox where emails tick up manically. So on a cold December morning I’m chasing calmness, standing at the banks of the River Thames near Syon Park in the west London borough of Hounslow, and focusing hard on flinging line across the brown water, with a 9ft, surprisingly light, fly-fishing rod (with a number 5 line since you ask). With the tide coming in over my boots and the swans sliding closer in that half-elegant, half-menacing way that they do, this doesn’t feel like the classic sport of the elite. “By no means is it now. It’s very accessible,” says Robin Elwes, of Sportfish, who is my instructor for the afternoon. A hugely experienced fisher, he is a passionate advocate for fly-fishing. “It is easy to pick up. It takes all ages, it takes all personalities. “There’s an awful lot of men who do it, and I wish there were more women and I wish a lot more children would turn to it and get themselves off their phones or laptops or whatever.” It’s certainly addictive. I love the methodical simplicity of the casting instructions, lots of “lift”, “stop” and “push and pull” that penetrate the most busy of heads. It is oddly restful. “Casting is not a great muscle movement. You don’t have to cast for miles and the rod’s an extension of your forearm, not your wrist,” says Elwes. I’m practising without a hook so no danger of catching anything today. That suits me fine. The Guardian photographer shares a lurid tale of being put off fishing for life after being expected to beat a poor landed fish to death in a boat. But if I’m going to eat fish then surely I should be able to catch it? That’s absolutely the idea, says Elwes. “I’m happy to put fish back, take what you need and leave the rest,” he says. He has been fishing, he says, since he could walk. “My grandfather took me, my mum taught me and my father paid for me, so I was lucky. Most of the holidays I remember involved fishing somewhere. It’s the love of my life, after my wife and family, as well as my bread and butter.” Being outside is a huge part of fishing, being by the river is calming even in the middle of the biggest conurbation in the UK. It’s quickly possible to zone out the noise of flights taking off from Heathrow and focus on the casting and the slow moving water. A fly-fishing starter set up can be bought new for under £100. “You can spend a fortune and still catch the same fish,” says Elwes, who is fast becoming my new mindfulness guru. “You don’t have to spend money on it, you don’t have to visit all sorts of exotic locations. You can go fly-fishing for free in places, you can go fly-fishing in the sea. “Once you’ve got the basics, get out and get on with it. Now cast away.” So I do. Robin Elwes can be contacted at Sportfish (an hour’s casting lesson is £50). For more fishing lessons, see fishingbreaks.co.uk.

        "Titre": "Rachel Roddy’s recipe for panzerotti – deep-fried dough parcels filled with cheese | A kitchen in Rome",
        "Auteur": "Rachel Roddy",
        "Date": "2024-07-22",
        "Texte": "The same Italian teacher who taught me to stuff vegetables in her brown kitchen introduced me to diminutive and augmentative suffixes using the word pancia, or “belly”. It was a good move on her part, teaching me via my stomach, and years on I still remember her lesson. It went something like this: the addition of -ino or -ina, depending on the gender of the pancia being described, produces pancino/pancina, or little belly. The suffix -etta has a similarly diminishing effect, as in pancetta, which also brings us to cured pork. At the other end of the scale, adding augmentative -ione or -iona produces more the ample pancione and panciona. My wise teacher also explained how, in southern dialect, pancia becomes panza, like the Spanish, so we remember ever-faithful Sancho Panza on his donkey; how the word panza gives us belly-shaped, deep-fried (or baked) filled dough parcels called panzerotti/panzarotti. Panzerotti are an adored culinary symbol in Puglia, as well as in Campania, Calabria and Basilicata, which makes sense, considering the proximity of the four regions and how panzerotti predate the borders we recognise now. The historian Luca Cesari wrote a wonderful piece for the magazine Gambero Rosso about the history of panzerotti, starting in the middle ages and, with the evolution of dough, the enclosing of a filling, which was then boiled, baked or fried. He moves swiftly through the centuries of dough filled with meat and then fried, observing tortelli in northern Italy, risshens in England and rissoles in France. He observes it was the French influence in Naples that was behind a 1790 recipe for fried dough filled with cheese and ham being called rissoles alla Napoletana, but how the author of the recipe, Francesco Leonardi, ends it by saying: “In Naples, these rissoles are called panzarotti”. Cesari notes that in Naples, the name panzarotti would be superseded by panzerotti, calzone and pizza fritta. Meanwhile, in Bari, by 1800, panzerotti were also being filled with a recently embraced immigrant, the tomato. Today, there is a whole world of panzerotti, fortified by strong and passionately held ideas of how they should be made. This range is good news for home cooks, because we can pick what suits us best. And, for me, this week that meant simple dough without yeast and a three-cheese filling, rather like Francesco Leonardi’s recipe from 1790. Panzerotti – deep-fried dough parcels filled with cheese Prep 25 min Cook 5-20 min Makes 10-12 350g plain flour 50g lard, butter or olive oil A pinch of salt 200g ricotta 3 tbsp minced parsley 1 egg 50g parmesan Nutmeg 100g mozzarella, diced 50g provola (or 50g more mozzarella), diced Lard, or olive, peanut or sunflower oil (approx. 1 litre), for frying Working in a bowl, mix the flour, fat, a pinch of salt and 160g warm water, and knead until everything comes together into a soft, smooth dough. Rest the dough under an upturned bowl while you make the filling. In second bowl, mash the ricotta, parsley, egg, parmesan and a grating of nutmeg into a rough paste, then stir in the diced mozzarella and provola. Making the panzerotti is a bit like making ravioli: roll the dough into a long strip about 20cm wide and 2mm thick. Put walnut-sized blobs of filling at 10cm intervals along the lower half of the strip, fold over the top half to cover the filling and press around it to get rid of air and seal. Use a cutter or glass to make half-moon shapes. In a saucepan, heat the lard or oil to 160C. It is best to fry the panzerotti in pairs: they will take about two minutes on each side, so four minutes in total, to turn deep golden brown. Once done, use a slotted spoon to lift them on to a plate lined with kitchen towel. Any excess dough and scraps can be fried like crisps. Alternatively, to bake the panzerotti, brush them all over with egg yolk, arrange on a baking tray and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 20 minutes, or until golden. Both fried and baked can be eaten immediately or left to cool, then wrapped up and taken on a picnic.

        "Titre": "Emma Hayes in at the deep end for USWNT’s latest Olympic odyssey",
        "Auteur": "Suzanne Wrack",
        "Date": "2024-07-22",
        "Texte": "This time last year Emma Hayes’s relationship with international football was very different. Her face adorned ITV’s posters promoting its commentary team for the broadcaster’s coverage of the Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The decorated Chelsea manager, celebrated for her astute technical analysis at both men’s and women’s major tournaments, was on a break from the day-to-day grind of club football management. The dismal showing of the back-to-back world champions, the USA, was picked apart by Hayes on screen and in print. Youth development in the US was criticised, a lack of creative talent coming through pinpointed as a key issue, and the togetherness of the team was questioned. A year on Hayes is having to convert those critiques into an action plan that will be immediately tested as the US bid to win their fifth Olympic gold and a first since the London 2012 Games. Hayes announced in early November last year she was leaving Chelsea at the end of the season. A few days later came the announcement that she would take the reins of the US women’s national team. The 47-year-old’s decision to leave Chelsea and take on arguably the biggest job in women’s football, replacing the disappointing tenure of former Reign FC manager Vlatko Andonovski as head coach of the US women’s national team, was bold but not unexpected. The timing of the announcement that she would be leaving Chelsea was a shock though, hurried out shortly after a 6-0 Women’s Super League win over Aston Villa in November. However, for those who have followed Hayes in recent years it had felt like her time at the club would be drawing to a natural conclusion sooner or later. Only the Champions League eluded Hayes during her time with Chelsea and there was a feeling, among fans and journalists alike, that were she to get her hands on a European title it would likely be her last hurrah with the club. The 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in the final in 2021 punctured the dream ending and, since then, while Chelsea have fought valiantly, the gap between them and the new queens of Europe has remained. Hayes has also suffered huge personal trauma and change in the last five years, including the loss of one of the twins she was carrying, the birth of son Harry, an emergency hysterectomy as part of her battle with endometriosis, and the loss of her father. These events have taken their toll. She has barely paused for breath, let alone to mourn her losses, making the less intensive day-to-day schedule of international football a huge pull. She also knows the soccer culture stateside well, having left England for the US in search of an environment that gave a damn about women’s football early in her coaching career. What should we expect from a Hayes-led USWNT at the Paris Games? It is hard to say. She arrived in the US towards the end of May, shortly after Chelsea secured their seventh league title on the final day of the WSL season and has not had much time to mould the team in person. In many respects, that lifts the pressure a little – Hayes is a hire for the long term and short-term success will be desired but is unlikely to be viewed as essential as long as fans and those around her can see potential in the systems and personnel. Already Hayes has shown she can be ruthless, omitting the figurehead Alex Morgan from the 18-player squad, the 34-year-old forward sacrificed to make way for younger players who will probably be the future of the team. Hayes can do that. Her incredible track record in club football gives her the authority. Now we get to see whether she can take a team known for their transitional, intense and physical game and prepare them for facing the increasingly technical and tactical football being played by teams around the world."

        "Auteur": "Adrienne Matei",
        "Date": "2024-12-01",
        "Texte": "My boyfriend’s parents coached youth sports teams in the 90s, so they have many anecdotes about how children handle winning and losing. Two cousins on separate soccer teams were so competitive that the one who lost would refuse the post-game high-five, instead retreating to some nearby bushes to cry. A little girl used to kick opponents with her ice skates during hockey; another refused to pass because her dad gave her cash for every goal she scored. One boy, when his team lost, lay flat out on the ice and simply wouldn’t get up. There’s a general consensus that, in addition to boosting fitness, youth sports impart valuable life skills, like teamwork and discipline. Winning and losing are especially significant, because they prepare children for the setbacks and challenges they will face in adult life. Expert opinion on the topic is not uniform, but many agree with that general logic. “Winning and losing experiences are crucial,” says Dr Billy Garvey, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician and author of Ten Things I Wish You Knew about Your Child’s Mental Health. For children, especially those aged five to 12, learning to navigate the ups and downs of competition is a stepping stone to stable self-esteem and resilience, he tells me. Garvey has a three-year-old daughter who, he tells me, is particularly competitive. “When she loses, I ensure that I connect with her, validate her frustration, anger or feeling that it’s unfair,” he says. Once she’s calmer, he adds, “I can help her learn the lesson in losing, by saying something like: ‘See how happy your little brother Charlie is that he won? I bet that feels nice for him.’” “Disappointment should always be complemented with unconditional love and support,” says Garvey. When kids are supported through losing, they benefit psychologically from the understanding that their worth is not tied to their performance, and that their effort and growth matter more than winning, he says. Meanwhile, winning can be a “genuine opportunity to take pride in themselves when that effort has been successful”. Jordan Lund has three children under age eight and coaches youth hockey, baseball and soccer in Squamish, British Columbia, in Canada. He agrees that kids need to experience competition, though a gentle approach is key. “Kids like to be challenged,” he says. “They have a fire and spirit in them to root for their teammates’ success and to accomplish things themselves.” Lund’s teams don’t use scoring or standings yet, but he believes it’s important for kids to learn about winning and losing, provided coaches create a psychologically safe environment. That means no yelling at kids to “look alive” or embarrassing those who fumble a play. “Some of the coaches we had in the 80s were not so conscious of that,” Lund remembers. *** Yet the environment of youth sports can often be shaped by a different set of values – one that prioritizes performance and victory above all else. Some experts argue that, in recent decades, youth sports, once a space for fun and personal development, have become increasingly high-stakes arenas where children are treated like miniature professional athletes. “Sport as a whole is becoming more competitive,” says Jaclyn Ellis, a Chicago-based mental-performance coach who works with athletes in their pre-teens and older. “It’s becoming harder for athletes to accept failure because the pressure to perform is so intense, even at young ages.” Ellis observes this in junior leagues, too, where parents of children who express early interest or skill at a certain sport may route their child toward a path of specialization and intense training, hoping it will lead to scholarships and a career. Ellis says over-ascribing to the win/lose binary is “called ‘all-or-none thinking’”, she says. “It’s very black-or-white, but most of the time, performance is not just good or bad – there’s a lot of grey area.” Rigid thinking can make losing a threat to a player’s sense of self, and also render winning joyless. Ellis described one 14-year-old soccer player’s body language after a successful play. “She scored a goal and walked back, shoulders drooping, and her coach was like: ‘What, no celebration?’ and she just said: ‘Well, it’s my job to score a goal. Why should I celebrate that?’” Ellis recounts. For perfectionists, this mindset can make them reluctant to even try unless they’re sure they can succeed flawlessly. “What is that teaching us?” Ellis asks. “We’re not willing to get out of our comfort zone, not even willing to try.” Ellis uses cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to help young athletes see that their worth isn’t tied to perfect outcomes. “We’re trying to rewire the brain to understand that ‘all or none’ thinking is hurtful to your mind and performance,” she says. Instead, she encourages young athletes to embrace challenges and imperfections, guiding them to see that growth is found not in a win or loss, but in having a positive mindset and mental flexibility. This “cultural obsession with winning” or “professionalization” of youth sports is one reason kids are losing their enthusiasm for sports, says Ryan Snelgrove, a professor of sport and recreation management at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. According to data from the Aspen Institute’s Project Play, the percentage of US children aged six to 12 who regularly played a team sport dropped from 45% in 2008 to 37% in 2021 – a trend mirrored in Canada, England and Australia. A 2024 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics reveals that 70% of children quit sports by age 13, often citing that they simply have stopped having fun. “Kids say: ‘I stopped playing because I don’t have fun anymore,’” says Snelgrove. When Amanda Visek, a sports scientist and associate professor at the George Washington University, asked children to list and rank factors that make sports fun, winning came in 48th place. She found that kids valued “trying your best”, “getting play time” and bonding with teammates more highly. Snelgrove has examined efforts to make youth sports more inclusive and boost participation. About a decade ago, Ontario Soccer and Canada Soccer launched player-development strategies that eliminated scoring and standings for children under 12, aiming to shift the focus from winning to skill development, cooperation and fun – the reason why parent and coach Lund’s teams don’t use scoring and standings. Not everyone supports this shift. “A silent majority of people are by and large indifferent in the sense that they understand that there is a value for not always keeping score for focusing on other components. And then, there are those who would be happy to see a little bit more competition,” says Lund. *** Some parents worry that removing the focus on winning undermines lessons in emotional strength and sportsmanship, says Snelgrove. “We have a lot of ‘character building’ social goals for youth sports,” he says, “but they’re a bit divorced from what developmental psychologists say is appropriate for children under 12, which is to focus mostly on enjoyment and developing cooperative skills.” “Sports become a battleground in the culture wars,” Snelgrove adds. Debates over the value of participation trophies often reflect broader societal concerns about giving children the opportunity to develop grit. For instance, in 2023, North Carolina Republican senators introduced legislation to enact a statewide ban on youth sports awards “based solely on participation”. In 2018, when USA Hockey shifted its focus away from scoring and standings for junior players, there was little fanfare – intentionally. “When you challenge [people’s] beliefs, they dig their heels in pretty quick,” Ken Martel, senior director of player and coach development at USA Hockey, tells me. Martel says USA Hockey is seeing growing registration: youth player rates increased 12% between 2009 and 2022. In the category for eight-year-olds and under, registration increased 94%. Soccer, meanwhile, has emerged as the most popular sport with Canadian children. It’s not possible to say how de-emphasizing scoring has affected these numbers, but it apparently hasn’t hurt. Such participation trends also cannot speak to whether non-scoring sports really deprive children of valuable life experience. But adult experiences rarely organize into a tidy win-or-lose binary. Instead, as Ellis says, it’s often about navigating complex grey areas – nuanced scenarios that go far beyond the simplicity of victory and defeat. If eliminating the specter of a win-at-all-costs mentality helps more young athletes find joy in challenge and play, it could also better prepare them to be adaptable, even when things don’t go as planned."

        "Titre": "‘It’s better not to try our luck again’: how Russia’s wars left deep scars in Georgia and Moldova",
        "Auteur": "Pjotr Sauer in Gori and Chișinău",
        "Date": "2024-11-01",
        "Texte": "Lately, Levan cannot stop thinking about the time he saw Russian tanks roll into his hometown of Gori, an hour’s drive from Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi. In 2008, Gori was one of the places Moscow bombed and occupied during a short and deadly war that left 20% of the country – though not the city – under de-facto Russian control. “When Russia invaded Ukraine, we began to worry they might come here again,” said Levan, speaking in the central square of Gori, known as the birthplace of Joseph Stalin and where a museum dedicated to the Soviet dictator attracts thousands of tourists each week. About 1,200 miles to the west, Sergiu, 62, has his own experiences with Russian aggression. In 1991, he was drafted in the Moldovan capital, Chișinău, and sent to Transnistria to fight Russian forces after the restive region had broken away from Moldova. The brief conflict ended in a 1992 ceasefire that left more than a thousand Russian troops stationed in Transnistria, which was granted autonomy but is internationally recognised as part of Moldova. Levan and Sergiu, both of whom requested their last names be omitted to speak freely, said the Kremlin’s wars had left deep wounds in their communities. They also saw their own country’s future in Europe, not Russia. Yet during an election in Georgia and a referendum in Moldova last month, polls widely seen as pivotal tests of whether the future path of the two former Soviet republics lay with Europe, Levan and Sergiu opted for political forces that favoured closer ties with Moscow, fearing that a pro-western government might provoke the Kremlin into a new war. The complex election results in these two small but politically significant countries have underscored the growing challenge the EU faces in expanding into territories that Moscow views as part of its sphere of influence. In Georgia, a ruling party viewed by most countries as increasingly Moscow-friendly and anti-liberal won a parliamentary election last Saturday that was marred by reports of voting violations and fraud. And in Moldova, only a razor-thin majority backed a key referendum of joining the EU, while the country’s pro-western president, Maia Sandu, faces a tough election runoff this Sunday against a candidate who has called for a “reset” of relations with the Kremlin. Last month, the Guardian visited Moldova and Georgia. In both countries, many voiced concerns about living under the looming shadow of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Some grappled with what they perceived as the harsh necessity of preserving peace – a reality that often overshadowed the allure of EU integration. “Peace is by far the most important objective for any government. It is better not to try our luck again and anger Moscow,” said Levan. He voted for the increasingly anti-liberal Georgian Dream (GD) party. It secured 54% of the vote in the parliamentary elections, a result that has in effect stalled the country’s longstanding aspirations to join the EU. Levan said he “fully agreed” with the party’s central campaign message: “Choose peace, not war”. He said he was worried the opposition would pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict. Others in his hometown seemed to share his concerns – GD won 57% of votes in Gori. In the weeks leading up to the elections, the ruling party displayed crude billboards across Tbilisi that featured images of bombed-out Ukrainian churches and sports arenas contrasted with idyllic scenes from Georgia. Speaking in Chișinău, Sergiu, who has retired from the military, said he voted in the country’s 20 October presidential election for the Moscow-friendly socialist candidate, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who advocates for better relations with Russia. Sergiu said it was naive to believe that Moscow would allow Moldova to join the EU. “Russia wants to keep us under their control forever. For now, we should stay neutral,” he said. Pro-western politicians in Moldova and Georgia have dismissed Russian invasion fears as scare-mongering orchestrated by the Kremlin, and instead stressed that only the west could guarantee long-term stability. They also reported that pro-Russian forces engaged in widespread disinformation and vote-buying campaigns had created a distorted picture of the actual public sentiment. Still, the voting in Georgia and Moldova suggests the threat of a Russian invasion resonates at least with certain parts of society, especially in conservative, poorer regions where economic progress has lagged and the promise of Europe feels distant and faint. It is a trend that has worried European officials. “We are losing the appeal of the EU to brute Russian force,” said one western official in Tbilisi. The outcome of the Georgian elections, where opinion polls once indicated that up to 80% of the population supported EU integration, has raised questions over the potency of Europe’s soft power. “The ruling party in Georgia has framed this vote as a choice between war and peace. For some, that choice feels more pressing than the question of being pro or against Europe,” the western official said. Ukraine’s increasingly bleak position on the battlefield, amid dwindling western support for Kyiv, has further validated those advocating for dialogue with Russia. “America and the EU have supported Ukraine and imposed massive sanctions on Russia. But it didn’t stop Russia … Ukrainian cities are ruined and so many people are dying,” said David Razmadze, a GD official in Gori. Razmadze said that in Georgia’s 2008 war with Russia, western allies did little to assist while Russian occupation troops remained stationed near Georgia’s border. “Georgians need to realise we are on our own. Europe will not come to our rescue,” he added. While the Kremlin has not directly threatened to invade either Georgia or Moldova, it has used its vast propaganda machine to highlight the devastation that followed Ukraine’s turn towards the west. The fear of a new Russian invasion is not the only factor keeping the region within its orbit. Both the GD in Georgia and pro-Russian groups in Moldova have stated their commitment to eventually joining the EU, but they have also criticised what they perceive as the west’s desire to compel their countries to abandon values of “family and church”. “The EU is forcing us to adopt LGBT legislation that goes against our traditions,” said Razmadze, saying he fully supported his party’s recent crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights that critics say is modelled on Russia’s. In Moldova and Georgia, two devoutly Orthodox Christian countries, the issue of LGBTQ+ rights remains sensitive. Political forces in both have sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiment by campaigning against what they perceive as western “moral degradation”. Russia’s economic influence also continues to loom large over the former Soviet region, casting a shadow on the promise of financial support that EU membership could offer. In Georgia, where the GD has refused to impose sanctions against Russia, direct flights from Moscow have recently resumed, bringing in thousands of Russian tourists each day. When the invasion in Ukraine prompted Moscow to reduce imports of French and Italian wines, it turned to Georgian wine, resulting in a profitable surge in exports for Georgia. In Moldova, some still yearn for the days of affordable Russian gas after Gazprom slashed supplies to the country by a third and demanded more than double the previous rates to maintain the flow, a move that was widely seen as political payback for Sandu’s pro-western stance. Stoianoglo in his campaign has pledged to seek negotiations for new gas supplies from Russia. On Wednesday, the European Commission announced it would not recommend opening EU membership talks with Georgia unless the country changed course. In the same report, the commission kept the door open for Moldova, whose geopolitical future will be once again be on the ballot on Sunday."

        "Titre": "Fremantle’s top-four spot suggests a deep run into September and beyond | Craig Little",
        "Auteur": "Craig Little",
        "Date": "2024-07-08",
        "Texte": "On Saturday night, Fremantle played a Richmond team whose year of injury and losses couldn’t be un-clustered with a crowbar and a Dusty fend-off (although put in a call to the AFL CEO and he may tell you that they’ve never been better). Josh Treacy kicked a career-best five goals, Andrew Brayshaw and Hayden Young combined for 60 possessions and three goals, and they handed out a pretty decisive pounding, winning by eight-goals and interest. To follow up last week’s win in Sydney so matter-of-factly suggests there is nothing illegitimate about Fremantle’s position in the AFL top four. It may not carry the same editorial weight as an eight-month discussion of the preternatural Harley Reid, but the fact that this Dockers team appears to be evolving into a genuine contender to run deep into September would seem, even to the untrained observer, worth at least a couple more pages in the back of the West Australian. Win next week in Tasmania against Hawthorn and they may just start to accumulate the same level of local press attention as they did when losing to Carlton in controversial circumstances in April, albeit without the burlesque conspiracy theories and pull-out posters of players who give up costly free kicks. While sitting on the sixth line of betting for the premiership, this team has all the qualities you’d want for a team to run deep into September. Even if they fall short this year, the Dockers should be set up for a sustained tilt at the club’s first flag. To look at each club’s age profile is to believe that it is Fremantle’s list that provides the most cause for hope. The Dockers’ midfield and forward lines are propelled by players born well after the club entered the league in 1995. Jye Amiss and Treacy are 20 and 21 respectively, Luke Jackson is 22, Caleb Serong, Jordan Clark and Hayden Young, 23, and Brayshaw 24. While Amiss and Treacy have together addressed the club’s offensive issues (Fremantle’s 16.9.105 was the fourth time they’ve cracked 100 this year), they remain a team built largely on a frugal defence. Just two years ago, the Dockers were able to win 15 games without a serious forward line, and this year they are one the league’s second-stingiest defences – only Sydney have given up less points, but the gap is just 15 points across 16 rounds. Even defensive telamones Luke Ryan and Alex Pearce (who is hoping to return next week after successful surgery on a broken arm) have much good football in front of them. It is all held together by a man who also has plenty of upside after taking charge of just his 100th game on the weekend. Justin Longmuir, who spent nine years learning the caper at West Coast and Collingwood is an astute tactician with an impassive terseness when discussing his team. On Saturday night, he accused his team of playing “one of their worst quarters of the year”. “To win by 50 points, you don’t want to be Debbie Downer, but I just think we’ve got so much improvement left in us,” he said. “We had some good moments and some things that would be a little bit frustrating. I thought we played to probably a seven out of 10.” It is a bluntness and call-it-as-it-is-ness that would be welcomed at the competition’s headquarters, but Longmuir’s players have clearly bought into his system and now hold the game’s second-longest winning streak at three – a giddy statistic in a non compos mentis year of football. “I don’t think we’re sneaking under the radar in club land,” said Longmuir. “But externally, I don’t really get caught up in it.” Although Hayden Young – who continues to impress in his evolution as a mid-forward – might be. Speaking to Fox Footy after the game, he said he didn’t mind flying under the radar. “We haven’t been to the pinnacle so a lot of people don’t put respect on our name,” he said. But should Fremantle’s form hold up as the field narrows through the brawl of the last seven rounds (the final four of which they play against sides currently sitting in the eight), the Dockers may well emerge as a genuine premiership threat. Particularly now that the foundation of this wild season’s only bone-deep assumption – that the Swans will be there at the end – is starting to ever so slightly wobble."

        "Auteur": "Phuong Le",
        "Date": "2024-07-29",
        "Texte": "Enveloped in a sonic cocoon of gentle ocean waves and rustling wind, the sensorial opening of Efthymia Zymvragaki’s feature-length debut could be mistaken for the start of a picturesque nature documentary. Zymvragaki’s film, however, excavates the pain buried beneath such scenic beauty: after escaping her abusive childhood home in Crete, Zymvragaki – now living in Spain – is transported back to her past by an unusual proposal. She receives a confessional memoir from Ernesto, a Tenerife resident with a troubled history of abuse against women. As Zymvragaki and Ernesto work together to bring his life to the screen, their stories collide in startling, heartbreaking ways. Both grew up under a domineering father who exercised a tyrannical control over his family. The coercive patterns were terrifyingly similar, alternating between periods of cold detachment and violent rage. In connecting the distant islands of Crete and Tenerife with this cycle of sorrow, Zymvragaki and Ernesto’s revelations lay bare the curse of intergenerational trauma. When it comes to interrogating Ernesto’s own abusive behaviour however, Zymvragaki’s inquiry is on shakier ground. In prioritising Ernesto’s experience, the film is curiously less interested in Juliane, his partner, and her reasons for being with him despite her own experience of domestic abuse. The use of re-enactment to process trauma, moreover, comes off as a particularly simplistic form of therapy. At one point, professional actors are hired to replay a scene of domestic violence; Ernesto even wraps his hand around the performer’s neck to demonstrate what happened. Regardless of his apologies, or the performer’s comfort with the scene, such moments raise crucial questions of safeguarding and exploitation; they are jarring enough to cast a dark shadow over the film. • Light Falls Vertical is on True Story from 2 August."

        "Titre": "Ex-CIA director Leon Panetta ‘hopeful’ that Trump will be more Reagan than ‘America First’ on national security",
        "Auteur": "Martin Pengelly in Washington",
        "Date": "2025-01-03",
        "Texte": "In January 2013, as US defense secretary, Leon Panetta lifted a ban on women serving in combat. Some time after January 2025, if Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s nominee for the role, is confirmed and stays true to his expressed position, that ban may be reimposed. “I’m particularly concerned about that, having been the secretary that opened up that opportunity for women to be in combat,” Panetta told the Guardian. “And I’m very proud of it, because I think they performed well. They’re great warriors. I’ve seen them in action in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. And we now have over 200,000 women who are part of the military … In a democracy like the United States, it makes sense for everyone who’s willing to serve to have that opportunity.” Women can fight. Ukrainian women prove it each day of their war with Russia. But Hegseth has said he thinks otherwise – and has also opposed service by out gay Americans, another group Panetta welcomed. Amid meetings on Capitol Hill – particularly with Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a Republican veteran herself – Hegseth has shown signs of retreat. But as actual policy differs from confirmation process chats, so Hegseth’s nomination remains controversial. Hegseth served in Iraq and Afghanistan and is now a Fox News host. Reporting has revealed mismanagement of veterans-based non-profits, stories of public drunkenness and allegations of mistreatment of women. And yet, in the age of Trump, with political norms shattered, Hegseth denies wrongdoing and remains in play. Panetta said: “I think a lot is going to depend on the FBI background check and whether it reflects more instances of abuse of alcohol or sexual deviation of one kind or another. And it’s also going to depend a lot on how he answers questions that relate to national defense. “In order to be secretary of defense, you better damn well be aware of what the dangers in the world are, and what are the threats that are out there, and how is the defense department going to respond to those threats. And so there’s a lot of areas to cover in order to really determine at a very critical time in our history whether he’s prepared to become secretary of defense.” Now 86, Panetta understand the demands of the job well. Under Barack Obama, he was secretary of defense from 2011 to 2013, after leading the CIA from 2009 to 2011. Before that, under Bill Clinton, he was White House chief of staff and budget chief. Before that, he was a member of Congress for 16 years, House budget chair for four. Before that, he was an army intelligence officer, a congressional aide and director of the office for civil rights. The New Yorker once called the Australian poet, essayist, humorist and TV presenter Clive James “a brilliant bunch of guys”. Panetta could be the political equivalent. Like James, he’s immensely engaging, laughing often, even when the subject is as serious as how Democrats should prepare for Trump’s second term. Panetta has spoken of the “moment of danger” he thinks Trump poses on US soil, from dreams of deploying troops against protesters and immigrants to disregard for political rules and long-held rights. But Panetta expects – “deep, deep down in my guts” – that norms and constitutional guardrails will continue to hold. In domestic and foreign affairs, Panetta counsels engagement. Speaking from his home office, from which he co-presents the One Decision podcast with the former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove and works with the Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, he said: “Democrats should be ready to see whether they can negotiate with Republicans, to find some kind of consensus. “This last Congress has been extremely dysfunctional, and the only way [House] Republicans have been able to pass anything is with Democratic votes, and so in a Congress where they’re going to have an even thinner majority, there are going to be opportunities.” Based on his own experience, Panetta thinks Democrats are presently “standing back and seeing whether or not [Republicans] can get their act together, or whether they self-destruct”. For some of Trump’s cabinet picks, self-destruction is an option. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration for attorney general. Hegseth’s fate is unsure. In contrast, Panetta sees few obstacles for Marco Rubio, the Florida senator nominated for secretary of state, or John Ratcliffe, a former congressman and intelligence official up to lead the CIA. Tulsi Gabbard, picked for director of national intelligence, raises greater alarm. Panetta said: “The role of DNI involves coordinating some 18 intelligence agencies in order to make sure that they’re providing consistent and credible information to elected leaders, and she has very little background in the intelligence arena, and that’s what concerns me.” A former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and a lieutenant colonel in the US army reserve, Gabbard has attracted controversy over positions and statements regarding Syria and Russia. Syria is now in chaos. Russia remains a chief concern. Widely seen to be too close to Vladimir Putin, Trump has promised to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. Most observers expect him to act to Russia’s advantage. Panetta is not so sure. To Panetta, Trump’s plunge into international affairs, meeting foreign leaders even while Joe Biden remains in the White House, is “a hopeful sign. I think he’s embraced something that I thought was really important: Ronald Reagan’s position of ‘peace through strength’. If [Trump’s] willing to follow Reagan, it leads you to playing the role of world leadership and building strong alliances. And so I’m hopeful Trump understands that the only way you’re going to deal with a very dangerous world is by working with our allies to develop common security.” Reagan championed Nato. Trump regularly threatens it. Nonetheless, this summer Panetta cited Reagan in his speech to the Democratic national convention, otherwise a strongly worded warning of the perils of a second Trump presidency. Reagan, Panetta said, “made very clear that the United States cannot be isolationist”. Trump ran on an isolationist slogan: “America First”. Asked if he really has any hope Trump will not turn to isolationism in power, and instead might instead continue to support Ukraine, Panetta said: “Well, it’s a good question. “Since Trump likes to project strength, I find it very difficult to think that he’ll suddenly just turn his back on Ukraine and allow Putin to succeed. I think that would make him look very weak as a leader, particularly as his first step. It would be comparable, in my book, to the mistake that Biden made with Afghanistan [in rapidly withdrawing, in 2021]. I hope that Trump recognizes that if he really wants negotiations, what he’s got to do is give Ukraine the leverage they need, to continue to provide them with weapons and support so they can gain the initiative.” ••• Panetta also insists on opportunities for progress in the Middle East, even though he expects Trump to give a “blank check” to Israel against Hamas in the Palestinian territories, against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in Syria too. “Israel has done a good job at weakening Hezbollah and Hamas and Iran, and I think it was pretty obvious that the mere fact that neither Russia nor Iran nor any of Iran’s proxies could come to the rescue of [Bashar al-]Assad [the fallen Syrian president], makes this a very important chance to try to … develop the opportunity that the Abraham accords provided.” Signed at the White House in September 2020, the Abraham accords established formal relations between Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, ranging all three against Iran. Panetta hopes the accords can also be used as a basis for “not only governance in Syria but hopefully Palestinian governance in some kind of state where they can both secure and govern themselves”. Iran is a major item on Trump’s plate. In 2015, the Obama administration joined a deal with Tehran, to contain its nuclear ambitions. In 2018, Trump pulled out. Now Trump is reportedly considering airstrikes. “There are a set of options out there, some of which can lead in a better direction, some of which I think could lead to war,” Panetta said. “A weakened Iran, if they make the wrong decision when it comes to developing a nuclear weapon, I think that could very well result in military action, not just by Israel but the United States. And I’m assuming [Iran is] aware of the fact it could mean the end of the regime. “… I guess the issue is whether Trump would be willing to have some of his own envoys engage in that dialogue [with Iran]. Because I think he understands that he did not really follow up on the United States getting out of the nuclear agreement. In his second term, the follow-up could very well be some kind of negotiations. If it isn’t, then the question becomes: ‘Do you continue to isolate Iran and hope that they can go the way of Syria?’ I don’t know that can happen either.” Asked if this is the sort of dilemma that keeps a defense secretary awake at night, Panetta laughs and agrees. He also begs pardon to take a call, then explains that the caller was Ted Balestreri, a California restaurateur who on New Year’s Eve 2010 told Panetta that if Osama bin Laden was brought to justice, he would honor his friend with a 141-year-old, $10,000 bottle of wine. As CIA director, Panetta knew the operation to capture or kill the al-Qaida leader, and avenge 9/11, was well under way. “So on 1 May [2011], when we conducted the operation [in which Bin Laden was killed], I called my wife and said: ‘Call Ted, tell him to look at the television. The president is going to make an announcement, and he owes me a bottle of wine.’ And she then got a call back, and he said, ‘The son of a bitch … he set me up.’ Anyway, we opened that bottle of wine.” Panetta laughs. Then he returns to the discussion at hand, of Trump, Russia, Iran, China, North Korea, terrorism and other foreign policy challenges – and nightmares – to come."

        "Titre": "Ukraine war briefing: US says striking deep in Russia no game-changer after Zelenskiy plea",
        "Auteur": "Guardian staff and agencies",
        "Date": "2024-09-07",
        "Texte": "The US has cautioned there is “no one capability” that would turn the war in Ukraine in Kyiv’s favour after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to let his forces use its long-range weapons to strike Russia. At a summit of Ukraine’s allies at Ramstein airbase in Germany, Zelenskiy on Friday repeated his plea for western nations to supply more long-range missiles and lift restrictions on using them to hit targets such as airfields inside Russia. However, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, pushed back on the idea that allowing deep strikes inside Russia would be a gamechanger, while also saying Washington and its allies would continue to strongly support Ukraine. “There’s no one capability that will in and of itself be decisive in this campaign,” Austin told reporters at the end of the meeting. He said Russia had already moved aircraft that launch glide bombs into Ukraine beyond the range of US-supplied Atacm missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskiy also raised concerns about western partners’ policies and the pace of weapons deliveries. “Now we hear that your long-range policy has not changed, but we see changes in the Atacms, Storm Shadows and Scalps – a shortage of missiles and cooperation,” the Ukrainian president said. Austin announced another $250m in US military aid for Ukraine at the Ramstein meeting. Other assistance included Germany pledging to supply an additional 12 self-propelled howitzers to Kyiv, and Canada saying it planned to send 80,840 surplus small unarmed air-to-surface rockets as well as 1,300 warheads in the coming months. Russian strikes on the central-eastern Ukrainian city of Pavlograd on Friday killed one person and wounded 64 others, including several children, officials said. Five Iskander ballistic missiles were fired from Russian territory towards Pavlograd in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine’s air force said. The wounded included five minors including a nine-year-old girl and two boys aged 11 and four, said the regional governor, Sergiy Lysak. “Several enterprises in the city were damaged by rocket attacks. More than 30 multi-storey buildings, a kindergarten and 27 shops were damaged,” he added. The attack led to “several fires in the city”, including in an apartment in a high-rise building. Russia regularly hits Pavlograd, home to a chemical plant that produces explosives. In a separate attack in the northern border region of Sumy, a Russian airstrike on the village of Krasnopillia on Friday killed a 66-year-old woman in her home and wounded four others, the regional prosecutor said. Russian forces have taken control of the village of Zhuravka in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday. The claim could not be independently verified. Hundreds of residents of Lviv packed into a church on Friday to mourn three sisters and their mother killed in a Russian strike that hit their home in the western Ukrainian city. Seven civilians were killed and more than 50 wounded in Wednesday’s drone and missile strike that hit a residential area of Lviv. Among the dead were Yevheniia Bazylevych, 43, and her three daughters Yaryna, 21, Dariia, 18, and Emiliia, 7. Any Iranian transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia would mark a “dramatic escalation” in the Ukraine war, the US said on Friday, after reports that the two countries had deepened ties in recent weeks with such an arms transfer. Reuters reported last month that Russia was expecting the imminent delivery of hundreds of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran and that dozens of Russian military personnel were being trained in Iran on the satellite-guided weapons for eventual use in the war in Ukraine. Short-range missiles have now been delivered to Russia by Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing an unnamed US official. France will use a share of €1.4bn ($1.5bn) in revenues from frozen Russian assets to finance purchase of military equipment for Ukraine, the defence ministry said. “Alongside other [EU] member states, the ministry … will take part in implementing the new support measure for Ukraine from the European Peace Facility,” it said on Friday. The European Commission in Brussels had given the go-ahead for “swift procurement of priority material from French industry” including ammunition, artillery and air defences, the ministry added. About €200bn of Russian assets have been frozen across the EU since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors said they had launched an investigation into the alleged Russian shooting of three surrendering Ukrainian servicemen on the eastern front near Pokrovsk, the main focus of Russia’s assault. Describing the latest in scores of such incidents Ukraine has reported, the prosecutor general’s office said on Telegram on Friday that it took place after Russian troops attacked a trench used by the Ukrainian military for cover on 27 August."

        "Titre": "Deep Sea review – underwater restaurant yarn cooks up dazzlingly psychedelic images",
        "Auteur": "Phuong Le",
        "Date": "2024-06-03",
        "Texte": "Having conquered the Chinese box office with the superhit Monkey King: Hero Is Back in 2015, director Tian Xiaopeng plunges into the whirlpool of childhood blues for his latest animated adventure. In contrast to the earlier film, which was drawn from the 16th-century novel Journey to the West, Deep Sea carries Tian’s first original screenwriting credit. While fantastical elements abound, the story is at its heart a coming-of-age tale about weathering the storm of grief and trauma. The central figure is a young girl called Shenxiu. Abandoned by her mother after her parents’ divorce, she also feels alienated from her father and his new wife, whose attention is showered solely on their own child. Outside, the world seems as hopelessly grey as Shenxiu’s nightmares, in which she constantly trails after her elusive mother. Even on a cruise with her family, she is lonesome and unmoored. When a fearsome thunderstorm strikes the cruise ship, however, the icy animation spectacularly changes, and Shenxiu finds herself transported to a kaleidoscopic underwater restaurant called Deep Sea frequented by anthropomorphic fish, walruses and fantastical creatures. Run by rakish chef Nanhe, the eatery’s chaotic operations seem to be an excuse for the film to flex its CGI prowess – sometimes at the cost of narrative coherence. Rarely staying still, characters and objects constantly bounce and hurl themselves around. The result can be dazzling, yet the visual overload is repetitive and exhausting. Much of the film’s emotional crux also rests on a redemption arc that feels slight amid the bombastic onslaught of visual tricks. Despite the tonal unevenness, however, the mix of hyperreal 3D animation and impressionistic compositions using the techniques of Chinese painting is unique to behold, like a tableaux roused into breathtaking life. • Deep Sea is in UK cinemas from 7 June."

        "Titre": "‘It enriches your mind in every way’: the fight to keep the UK learning German",
        "Auteur": "Kate Connolly in Berlin",
        "Date": "2024-08-17",
        "Texte": "When Londoner Amber Tallon started learning German at the age of 12, she “took to it like a duck to water”, she says. An A-level in the language and modules in German at the University of Oxford, where she studied history, have helped her, now 30, to her “dream job”, working as a Blue Badge Guide in London, where some of the large range of tours she offers are to German students. “As English people we have such a bad rap for not learning languages, assuming that everyone is going to speak English. I think it’s just polite to learn even the basics of the language … it puts you on the right foot,” she says. She volunteers a few of her favourite German compound words, to illustrate “how creative a language it is … the heart of the matter captured in a single word”. “Schokoladenseite”, which translates literally as chocolate side and means a person’s good side, and “Kabelsalat” (tangled cables), are two of her treasured gems, both nodding to the American humorist Mark Twain, who wrote in 1880 that acquiring the “art of German” was akin to assembling a collection of “alphabet processions”. Caroline Wyatt, a BBC presenter whose long career as a foreign correspondent started in Berlin in the early 90s thanks to her German language skills, says learning German “really enriched my life as a human being”. “It takes away the fear … because thanks to the language, you think: ‘I can understand this place.’” As a result, she recalls being “perfectly happy” when she secured a job as a business correspondent for the BBC World Service in Berlin in 1993 in her mid-20s “to slip a suitcase in the back of a car, head to Harwich, get on a ferry and drive to Berlin before satnav. “It wasn’t that it wasn’t scary, but it just felt like the world was opening up.” Tallon and Wyatt are something of a rarity these days, with the number of pupils having chosen to study German at A-Level in 2024 standing at just 2,261. Entries for German have more than halved over the last decade, there is an increasing dearth of German teachers (not helped by Brexit) and some higher education institutes are considering closing down their German departments. The decline has prompted a wider community of German scholars, with diplomats and the occasional politician, to search for creative ways to prevent German being consigned to the academic scrapheap. Next month, the Association for German Studies in Great Britain and Ireland will meet for its 92nd annual conference, hosted by the German department at the University of Leeds, to discuss the future of studying the language. One of its keynote speakers, the German ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, is behind the initiative “Making the Case for German”, together with the Goethe Institut, and the UK Department for Education’s (DoE) German promotion programme – a joint effort with the British Council to re-energise language learning in state-maintained primary and secondary schools in the UK. Hatched under the last government, all participants hope the latter project will also be embraced by the new administration. Berger says the aim is “to make German once again a more popular choice for language learners in the UK”. Andrea Pfeil, the Goethe Institut’s head of language for north west Europe, says language skills are still needed in the job market in the UK, where “German is the most sought-after foreign language … especially since Brexit”. Knowledge of German appeals to employers above and beyond the ability to speak it, Pfeil says. “Applicants with A-level German have a veritable Alleinstellungsmerkmal (a unique selling point), because they demonstrate a level of overall competence that gives them better access to the job market. “This is something that parents are often more interested in than pupils initially. This also goes for the fact that Britons with German language skills can study in Germany, where there are, in general, no student fees, which is a huge advantage.” Pfeil believes German learning could thrive in the long term if more people become aware of its advantages. The Goethe Institut, with the DoE, has also engaged the talents of Axel Scheffler, the UK-based German illustrator of The Gruffalo and other Julia Donaldson characters, in the hope of boosting enthusiasm for German language learning in primary schools and helping its progress in secondary schools and beyond. Scheffler has produced illustrations for a series of stories about an alien who arrives in Germany, aimed at encouraging an interest in the language. “It’s obvious the earlier you start the better, and that learning foreign languages is important especially in this country, especially after Brexit which I think closed Britain off more from the rest of Europe,” Scheffler says. “Being bilingual myself and living in another language, I think any other language enriches one’s mind, one’s chances in life in every way, the openness to other cultures.” Henning Wehn, the German standup comic who came to Britain more than 20 years ago hardly able to speak English, who was recently credited by King Charles for having “given us an understanding of German quirks”, says language learning is crucial to “opening your mind”, but believes all the teaching in the world is no replacement for immersion in the country itself. “The only time you really learn the language is living in the country … you become part of the fabric. Google Translate is no substitute for connecting, for understanding the jokes, or Only Fools and Horses.”"

        "Titre": "Deep listening: the haunting sonic world of Cassandra Miller",
        "Auteur": "Imogen Tilden",
        "Date": "2024-04-11",
        "Texte": "“I steal people’s souls”, says Cassandra Miller. The 47-year old Canadian composer sits in her light-filled living room at the top of a London block of flats, looking tranquil and as unlike a master of the dark arts as it is possible to imagine. Miller’s intimate and engaging compositions take as their starting point existing melodies, which she variously deconstructs, loops, magnifies and utterly transforms. The act of transcription is an inherently creative process in her hands, and the physicality of a performance – ornaments, notes, pauses, breaths and even sighs – is a vital part of what she transcribes. “When I start with source material, I’m interested in the entirety of somebody’s performance,” Miller says. “I’m sort of stealing part of their humanity. It’s like making a portrait of somebody.” In the past decade, Miller’s profile has risen rapidly. Her works have been performed in concert halls from New York to Warsaw and Oslo to Barcelona; last year’s Aldeburgh festival premiered her “quietly captivating” La Donna, and her 2015 Duet for Cello and Orchestra was named one of the Guardian’s Best of the 21st century – “A strange but profoundly haunting piece,” wrote Andrew Clements. Like most of her compositions, it is a piece of expansive and luminous beauty whose apparent simplicity belies its complexities. Inspiration has come from sources as various as Bach, birdsong, Kurt Cobain and Bellini. In 2023’s The City, Full of People, she transcribed herself singing a passage of Thomas Tallis’s 16th-century setting of lines from Lamentations and expanded the transcription into a score for 16 singers. “On its journey with Miller, Tallis’s somber austerity has been gently blurred, taking on a circling, overlapping, dreamlike melancholy and a surprising joy,” said the New York Times. Thanksong, written for Quatuor Bozzini and singer Juliet Fraser, is based on the third movement of Beethoven’s late Quartet Op 132 (the Heiliger Dankgesang). Miller sang along to the four individual string lines of the quartet, many times in repetition, transforming the material into gentle pendulum-like repeated gestures. The composition is held together by the pacing and breath of Fraser, singing the distilled essence of Beethoven as slowly and quietly as possible. The piece feels organic and fragile. The shimmering Daylonging, Slacktide, written for viola player Lawrence Power, is the work of Miller’s that first stopped me in my tracks, its melodic origins in a traditional song about the beauty of Georgia, but the unmooredness of 2020’s lockdown also brings its emotional impact. “All is suspended now – time is dilated, and like many others, I’m like a sailboat at sea with no wind,” wrote Miller of the composition’s mood. “I love to explore the idea of accidental, she says. “It’s like the source material is a question because I don’t know at first what I’m going to do with it.” This week sees the premiere of her latest work, a concerto written for guitarist Sean Shibe. Named Chanter after the part of the bagpipes on which the melody is played, it takes as its source melody a performance by Scottish smallpipes player Brìghde Chaimbeul of O Chiadain an Lo, an old Highland air that Chaimbeul herself had transformed by translating it for her instrument and into a minor mode. “Sean and I started by sharing music that we liked,” says Miller. Their mutual love of Scottish music quickly became a focus, they both knew Chaimbeul and loved this plaintive track. “There’s something really magical about how she plays it, like she’s singing.” Singing was precisely what Miller then asked Shibe to do, which can’t have been what the virtuosic guitarist might have expected. Luckily Sean is up for anything, she says. She recorded him singing along to O Chiadain an Lo. He then sang along to his own recorded voice again and again, reclining on the sofa, until he was somewhere between sleep and song, a process she calls automatic singing-in-meditation. And yet we don’t hear Shibe’s voice – at least not literally – in the final work. “The goal of the transcription process is to transform the source material into a new melody informed by the physicality of the source material, but also by the physicality of the person who is transforming it. So in this case, it’s Sean singing,” she says. This combination of Shibe singing Chaimbeul’s melody, and of Chaimbeul’s own playing infusing it, formed the skeletal architecture for the guitar part of the final concerto. Layers. Ghosts. Echoes? Yes and no. “It’s hard to describe, and whenever I try, I feel I’m not doing it quite right,” Miller admits. “Chaimbeul’s tune – used, of course, with her permission – has been transformed into something new, but without her work, nothing of the concerto would exist. Small ‘truth-window’ moments of her melody can be heard in the string ensemble, as occasional shafts of richly coloured light.” Miller has been composing since she was a student in British Columbia. She went to the University of Victoria to study harp, and on the first day took a composition class. “By the end of the 45-minute class, my heart had changed and I was like: ‘OK, this is what I’m doing now.’” She went on to study with Richard Ayres and Yannis Kyriakides in The Hague and in the UK with Michael Finnissy and Bryn Harrison. Her home is London these days, and her listening and influences are omnivorous. “I do love classical music, but it’s not my home base any more than any other type of music,” she says. Every evening over dinner in the flat she shares with fellow composer Leo Chadburn, 6 Music is on and she loves how she is always hearing things she didn’t know. So what else excites her? Free jazz – “for its vibrant physicality, in particular Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane”, plus music from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and northern Greece; Brazilian jazz, and Italian and Sardinian folk. Closer to home, folk musicians she listens to include Richard Dawson, Stick in the Wheel, Aidan O’Rourke - “because of how they make work that somehow sounds like it always existed – which is often also what I go for in my own way.” Her teachers, colleagues and collaborators are her main influences, she says. She works frequently with the same musicians: Fraser and Power, and improvising violinist Silvia Tarozzi, and she has a longstanding relationship with the Quatuor Bozzini. “They have taught me about half the things I know about music in a practical and spiritual sense. And Sean [Shibe] is becoming a really important person on that level too.” Classical-wise, early-20th-century French composers Satie, Debussy and Ravel – “from a time when musical ‘pleasure’ was expressed through the colour rather than the trajectory of harmony”, are influences. She also cites fellow Canadians Linda Catlin Smith and Martin Arnold, while US experimental composer Pauline Oliveros and her philosophy of deep listening is very close to her heart – “a massive influence”. If you file Miller under M for minimalism, she is OK with that. “People need labels – it helps you navigate and certainly what I write often involves a kind of repetition, recognisable harmonies and an expansive sense of time.” Really, though, what she’s doing and how she does it, feels quite unique. “I think of the primary tool of composition as listening. So if I develop myself as a listener, then that’s the main way to develop myself as a composer. If I hear some music in the world and it moves me, then I want to go deeply into that. It’s become how I work.” But there’s no prescription for how to listen. “A piece of music is just a sort of a place to live in for a while,” she says. “I wouldn’t ever want to impose how an audience member has to listen. When I’m in a concert, my mind is usually wandering, and I love it. In a concert hall, someone in row A is going to have a different experience to someone in the gallery. And it’s not just where they’re sitting in the hall. It’s about who they are as a person and how they have felt about every single piece of music they’ve ever heard in their life, and what they had for breakfast that day and everything! The piece exists in the person’s ears, right?” Sean Shibe and the Dunedin Consort perform Chanter at Milton Court, London on 11 April, then Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden (12 April), Glasgow Royal Concert Hall (13 April) and Queen’s Hall, Edinburgh (14 April). This article was amended on 12 April 2024. Cassandra Miller studied at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, not Victoria University, which is in Australia, as a previous version said."

        "Titre": "Ipsos poll shows just how deep a hole the Conservatives are in",
        "Auteur": "Gideon Skinner",
        "Date": "2024-06-18",
        "Texte": "The findings from today’s Ipsos MRP poll show in no uncertain terms just how much trouble the Conservatives are in. Our model has the Conservatives winning just 115 seats, with Labour on 453. To compare, in 1997 Tony Blair’s Labour party won 418 and John Major’s Conservatives 165. On these results, the Conservatives could be heading for their worst general election defeat in modern political history. There is often a lot of mystery surrounding multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) in terms of what it is and how it works. In simple terms, we run a large-scale survey of almost 20,000 people on our online KnowledgePanel, recruited according to gold-standard random probability methods. This gives us a granular picture of how different demographic groups are likely to vote across the country. Then, because we know what proportion live in different constituencies, we can project the probabilities for how individual seats will vote, within certain confidence ranges. One of the key benefits over a normal poll is that the geographic detail helps us understand the pattern of current voting intentions. And we have produced a whole range of interactive maps for fellow geeks to get lost in. Looking at that detail explains why the Conservatives are performing so badly nationwide. Rishi Sunak’s party is losing support across the country, but especially in stronger areas such as the east and south of England and across the Midlands. Meanwhile, Labour is making more modest advances in its heartlands in highly urban areas, but bigger gains in Scotland and the north-east. Support for the Conservative party is falling most where it was strongest in 2019. Sometimes referred to as a “proportional swing”, this means it is losing more seats in the first past the post system than if the swing against it was more uniform. There is still some debate about what will be the final nature of the swing on election day – whether it will be more proportionate or more uniform – but the pattern shown in the raw survey data could be highly damaging for the Conservatives, as it was in the local elections and recent byelections such as Wellingborough. The Conservatives also find themselves challenged on both flanks by other parties. It has been manifesto week for Reform UK and our model shows them winning three seats, including Nigel Farage’s in Clacton. Our model also shows the Liberal Democrats taking seats off the Conservatives in the south of England. The top four issues according to the public have been clear for some time – the NHS, the economy, cost of living and immigration – and across all of them public dissatisfaction with the government’s record is deep. The Conservatives’ brand image as a party fit to govern has more than halved since 2019, and it can no longer rely on having a leader who is preferred to the opposition – Sunak is in the worst position of any prime minister starting an election campaign in Ipsos records going back to the 1970s. The public wants a change – even if they are not completely enamoured of Labour – and the Conservatives are finding that tide of opinion difficult to shift. We should always remember that polls and models such as this are snapshots of public opinion and not predictions of what is to come – we need to allow for some uncertainty in our interpretation. Things can change between now and polling day, but what is clear is that the Conservatives are losing support across the country, in different directions, and are in a deep political hole. Time will tell to what extent they can dig their way out, if they can at all. Gideon Skinner is head of politics research in public affairs at Ipsos • This article was amended on 19 June 2024. An earlier version said that the Conservatives won 178 seats in the 1997 general election; this was actually the number of seats they lost."

        "Auteur": "Leslie Felperin",
        "Date": "2024-06-18",
        "Texte": "Screened at SXSW last year but still relevant given the ongoing debate about immigration in the US, an especially live issue in election year, this offers a border-set ghost story that’s haunting in more ways than one. For a start, it’s not especially gory or scary; the tone is more melancholy and guilt-freighted, offering a study of masculine and, in particular, paternal anxiety that’s aggravated by divided loyalties. The main protagonist is Angel Waters (Roberto Urbina), a Mexican-American border guard who is the head of his small patrol unit not far from El Paso. The son of a Mexican father he never knew and a white American woman who has recently died, Angel is now devoted to his pregnant wife Hannah (Kendal Rae, achieving a lot with a thinly written part); he only wants to do the best he can for the people who cross the border every day, even if he’s seldom thanked for sometimes saving their lives. For example, one day he shouts warnings in Spanish that the river isn’t safe to a lone stranger (Julio Cesar Cedillo) he spots trying to cross, and minutes later the man is swept away. Angel finds what appears to be the man’s body downriver, puts it in a body bag and heads for headquarters, only for the corpse to revivify itself and demand he be taken to El Paso where some people need him. Angel is called away by Hannah to deal with an old man (Manuel Uriza) who claims to be Angel’s father, now broken out of a psychiatric hospital and ranting about trees and their mirroring system of roots underground, a potent metaphor throughout. Are the two strangers related in some way? And is the latter one his father, or perhaps the other guy, or neither? The plot thickens after violent events, and writer-director Lance Larson, making his feature debut here after cranking out several shorts, blends in issues around racism, border policy, post-traumatic stress disorder and more. And yet the script, credited to Larson and cinematographer Jas Shelton, whose imagery is often breathtaking, seldom feels heavy-handed or too freighted with authors’ messages. It’s a textbook example of horror tropes being used to smuggle in deeper themes, while still providing a fair few entertaining jump scares and spooky vibes. • Deadland is on UK and Irish digital platforms from 24 June."

        "Titre": "The Guardian view on Horrible Histories: laughing to learn | Editorial",
        "Auteur": "Editorial",
        "Date": "2024-12-06",
        "Texte": "“It must be horrible, funny and true,” the writer Terry Deary said of adapting his multimillion-selling children’s books series Horrible Histories for TV. First aired on CBBC in 2009, the show is now into its 11th series. Last week it added a Bafta Special Award to its nine children’s Baftas and two British Comedy Awards (the only children’s show to win in that category to date). The International Prix Jeunesse named it the best non-fiction children’s show of the last 50 years. Silly, subversive and obsessively scatological, Horrible Histories is more successful than an educational comedy sketch show for kids deserves to be. An unholy mix of Blackadder and Monty Python, it has transformed children’s television. There have been spin-off films and plays across the country, two riotous Proms and a grisly river tour along the Thames. A generation of children can now recite the kings and queens of England thanks to the 2011 Monarchs’ Song, remixed for the coronation in 2023. Other greatest hits include Norman Style, in which William the Conquerer shows off his Gangnam Style moves and Born 2 Rule, sung by boyband the 4 Georges. Boudiccca has become a mini-feminist anthem, and Beatrix Potter, Enid Blyton, Jacqueline Wilson and Malorie Blackman come together in the Storyteller’s Little Mix sketch: “a hero can be a she-ro too!” No wonder kids give it full marks. It is undeniably horrible and funny, but is it true? It might not be AJP Taylor, but Horrible Histories prides itself on ensuring accuracy is never sacrificed for a good rhyme or gag. And it’s not just tights and togas. As the show’s executive producer, Richard Bradley, has said, “Horrible Histories has a political dimension with a small p.” At a time when the curriculum and literary canon are under intense scrutiny, the show gives a lighthearted take on the most serious issues. It is unafraid to take on the darker aspects of history, consistently championing the representation of women and diversity (with sketches on pioneering figures like Rosa Parks and Mary Seacole), and tackling Britain’s colonial legacy. Although Deary does not write the sketches, the books take a similar stance. In an interview for his first book for adults, A History of Britain in Ten Enemies, published in October, he said he loathed the British empire “with a passion”. In 2020, the Daily Mail accused Horrible Histories of “trashing Britain” after airing, on the day Britain left the EU, the archive song British Things, in which Queen Victoria’s servant sings: “Your British things are from abroad and most are frankly stolen.” (The sketch stars Sarah Hadland, who has swapped Victorian mourning dress for sequins as a contender in this year’s Strictly.) In fact, Horrible Histories is a very British phenomenon, part of a long tradition of self-parody. This may explain why the model hasn’t been copied abroad. Fifteen years after it first exploded on our screens, there is still nothing like it. Children’s television is in crisis. With more choices of entertainment at their fingertips than ever before, young viewers have been migrating to online platforms. But Horrible Histories continues to thrive. Next spring, the team is releasing Horrible Science – expect more blood, poo and death. Why change a winning formula? With its unofficial motto “laugh yourself smart”, the show is a tonic for our anxious times. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. • This article was amended on 10 December 2024 because an earlier version referred to Horrible Histories as the only children’s show to win a Bafta special award. The reference should have been to the show being the only children’s show to win British comedy awards."

        "Titre": "Spain’s dream team of Alcaraz and Nadal dig deep to advance in Olympic doubles",
        "Auteur": "Tumaini Carayol at Roland Garros",
        "Date": "2024-07-27",
        "Texte": "When a 12-year-old Carlos Alcaraz was asked to name his favourite tennis player, his answer was not what many would have expected. During his childhood, Alcaraz saw himself most in Roger Federer’s high-octane, all-court attacking style, the brand of tennis that he aspired to copy. In recent years, that answer has changed. With age, it seems, Alcaraz has come to truly understand the undeniable influence Rafael Nadal has had over his career and of so many around him. Having already experienced the ecstasy of defeating his idol in battle, this time Spain’s past and future greats converged on the same side of the court. Despite Nadal’s lack of matches and Alcaraz’s unfamiliarity with doubles, the Spaniards thrived under pressure in the decisive moments as they toppled Andrés Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez, the sixth seeds from Argentina, to reach the second round of the Olympics with a 7-6 (4), 6-4 win. “It was a dream come true, honestly,” said Alcaraz. “I dreamed about playing my debut in the Olympic Games, but playing with Rafa it was even more special. I’m really happy about the level we played, I’m really happy to give us the chance to keep going, to play another round. I think our level is good enough to believe and hopefully keep going.” Since Nadal revealed that he was keen to play doubles with Alcaraz at the Olympics, the hype has been overwhelming. It reached fever pitch just before 7pm on Saturday night as Billie Jean King was ushered on to the court – to a standing ovation – to hype up the stadium before two more champions emerged. Even the opponents added to the occasion. As has been the case for most Argentinian athletes so far at the Olympics, Gonzalez and Molteni were booed from the moment they stepped on to the court (the Argentina football team were filmed singing a derogatory song aimed at a number of France players during their Copa América celebrations) and the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd was relentless in their support of their Roland Garros champions. Alcaraz has played doubles at only six tournaments and that inexperience was painfully clear early on as he struggled with his decision-making and looked clueless at the net. While Nadal tried to take control he also struggled with his return and timing on his groundstrokes. The Argentinians, meanwhile, are solid top 20 doubles players and regular partners. Amid bursts of brilliance from Nadal and Alcaraz, Molteni and Gonzalez were solid on serve and return and defended the net well. As they have been so many times in singles, though, Nadal and Alcaraz were so sharp in the decisive moments. With the first-set tie-break level at 3-3, they simultaneously stepped up, their energy rising as they fed off each other. In an array of nuclear forehands, relentless aggression and their trademark accompanying roars, the Spaniards rolled through. Likewise, after starting the second set slowly and trailing 0-3, they methodically found their way back into the contest and by the time they snatched the decisive break for 5-4, Alcaraz was lasering brilliant returns while Nadal eviscerated forehands at will. As the crowd chanted “Rafa” in unison, Nadalcaraz closed out a wildly enjoyable night with their first win. “We played well,” said Nadal. “It has been a very tough start against a great couple, they are so good, they are used to playing together. It has been an emotional night, an electrifying night, amazing crowd and to play with Carlos in this court has been so special. Just super happy about the victory and to give us the chance to keep going.” A night earlier, Nadal was revealed as one of the final torchbearers of the Olympic flame in the Paris 2024 opening ceremony, taking the baton from Zinedine Zidane, joining with Serena Williams and handing it over to Amélie Mauresmo in scenes that also underlined the star power of tennis’s legends. Alcaraz is clearly following in the footsteps of those champions. However far they go in the draw, this was a perfect, fitting moment between a 38-year-old in the final stretch of his career and his 21-year-old compatriot who has taken hold the baton with both hands. “Yesterday was a super emotional moment for me too,” said Nadal “I can’t thank enough Paris and France to give me that honour. I’m still with the emotions very high, just enjoying every single moment and let’s see what’s going on.” Earlier, Novak Djokovic reached the second round with an easy 6-0, 6-1 win over Matthew Ebden, an Australian doubles specialist, as all outdoor matches were postponed due to rain. Nadal is scheduled to face Marton Fucsovics on Sunday afternoon, and a win would set up a 60th meeting between Djokovic and Nadal in the second round. Although Nadal looked OK in the doubles half court, he has been struggling with thigh pain over the past week and he remains uncertain about whether he will take to the court in the singles."

        "Titre": "‘I find myself getting in a little too deep’: Sean Baker on his Palme d’Or-winning lapdance film",
        "Auteur": "Ryan Gilbey",
        "Date": "2024-10-21",
        "Texte": "Sean Baker is fastidious about research, plunging himself into the milieu of whatever he happens to be making a movie about. And yes, he knows how that looks. “People online are like, ‘Oh, Sean is such a horndog! That’s the only reason he makes those films.’” He gives one of his joyful, crinkle-faced grins, his eyes vanishing into creases, his entire face seeming to smile. At 53, he looks as if he fell in the fountain of youth. His boyish ebullience and tousled hair lend him a Richie Cunningham wholesomeness which contrasts amusingly with the subjects of his films, if not with their bubbly, irrepressible tone. His charming fourth feature, Starlet, was a buddy movie about a young female porn actor and a cranky elderly widow. His fifth – the riotous breakthrough hit Tangerine, shot with three iPhones on a $100,000 budget – was set among transgender sex workers on LA’s Santa Monica Boulevard. Red Rocket concerned another porn star, older and disreputable this time, who tries to coax his teenage girlfriend into the same career. Baker’s latest film, Anora, is a glorious, high-energy tragi-comedy about a Russian-American lapdancer, played by the Oscar-tipped Mikey Madison, who comes to regret her impetuous marriage to the giggly 21-year-old son of a Russian oligarch. The director still looks stunned that Anora scooped the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival this year. “I just thought I’d made a crazy-ass exploitation movie,” he says, his face crinkling again. If the impression he gives is of a U-rated boy in an X-rated world, that fits with his childhood memories of accompanying his father, who worked as a lawyer in Manhattan, on trips into the city from their home in New Jersey. “It was a ‘Welcome to the jungle’ moment every time,” he gasps. “We’d drive out of the Lincoln Tunnel and that would bring you right down 42nd Street. This was the heyday, when it was full of grindhouses and porn theatres. It would be ‘Marilyn Chambers XXX’ everywhere.” He mimics his younger self, eyes on stalks as he gazes from the passenger window: “‘Whoa! What’s going on?’ That stuff really stayed with me.” Maybe the people crying “horndog” have a point. “There was a certain amount of hands-on research for Anora,” says Baker, aware that this is not merely a figure of speech. In preparation for writing the film, he frequented the clubs where Anora (or Ani, as she prefers to be called) might work. This was no solo mission: he was accompanied by Madison, whom he had cast before even writing the script, having seen her playing one of the Manson family in the gory climax of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Also in attendance at the clubs were Samantha Quan, Baker’s wife and producer, and one or two other crew members. But still. “We participated in lapdances,” he says sheepishly. “We had to. It was the most embarrassing thing, real Curb Your Enthusiasm stuff. I’m trying to do an interview while also having a lapdance, which is so ridiculous. Halfway through the dance, I would be like, ‘OK, so what does a guy normally do at this moment?’ I’d totally kill the vibe. The dancers were cracking up.” Some of them had had experiences that were not so different from what they envisaged Ani going through in the film. “There was a sad, sobering moment where one woman said, ‘This happened to me.’ I don’t know if it was an oligarch, but she married into a rich family and they rejected her. She got teary-eyed about it.” The film alludes to the generally sanitised Hollywood view of sex work by showing Ani’s young husband-to-be sliding across the floor of his mansion in his socks, just like Tom Cruise in Risky Business, the 1983 comedy about a teenager who turns his house into a brothel for the night. But Baker found that the Pretty Woman paradigm still endures: “We heard it from many dancers, ‘Once I marry that rich businessman, I won’t have to do this any more.’” It’s not so different from playing the lottery, is it? “Sure. You get it in all lines of work, all areas of life. ‘One day I’ll …’” Win the Palme d’Or? “Exactly!” How can a woman like Ani find fulfilment? “Getting the respect she deserves from somebody who actually sees and hears her would be a step,” Baker reflects. “Part of the reason I made the film is because I realised our Cinderella stories have changed in the last 10 years. It’s about wealth and fame now. When I was growing up, the American dream was a house in the suburbs and, hopefully, you’d make enough for your kids to go to college. That was pretty much it. That’s changed, and this is maybe what the film is commenting on.” It is easy to imagine a nastier version of the movie, in which Ani’s Russians in-laws don’t bother trying to get the marriage annulled, but instead kill her and dump the body in the Hudson. But what’s striking about Baker’s films is that – despite his characters’ poverty, criminality, desperation and drug use – they are largely devoid of menace. Anora may owe much to Jonathan Demme’s 1986 screwball thriller Something Wild, but it has no equivalent to the terrifying sociopath played by Ray Liotta in that movie. Perhaps there is an inherent sweetness in Baker’s outlook that precludes him from engaging with that species of threat? “It’s funny because I watch very extreme films and I’m friends with people like Gaspar Noé,” he says, namechecking the director of the gruelling Irreversible. “But you’re right. I’ve never gone there. I don’t know why.” Even firearms are conspicuous by their absence: Baker’s 2004 film Take Out, about a Chinese immigrant working as a delivery driver, is the only one of his films to feature a gun. It was 15 years ago that Baker and the actor Karren Karagulian, who has starred in all his movies, started discussing what would eventually become Anora. From the start, they set themselves the challenge of making a gangster story, set in the Russian-American community of Brighton Beach (also known as Little Odessa), without ever showing a gun. “We wondered, ‘Is it even possible?’” Anora proves it is. Guns and menace aren’t the only elements missing from Baker’s movies. Aside from Willem Dafoe, who was Oscar-nominated for playing a sweet-natured motel manager in 2017’s The Florida Project, Baker has steered clear of stars, perhaps fearing that they could wreck the loosey-goosey methods that are vital to his work: the extensive improvisations, the last-minute rewrites, the scenes where actors mingle with unsuspecting members of the public. “I have a lot of friends in the industry who have had nightmare experiences working with big Hollywood actors,” he says. “I don’t know how they get through the day. I would throw in the towel. I would love to work with Jennifer Lawrence or Leonardo DiCaprio some time. I hear they’re great! But you never know. It could really derail a movie.” His immersive process, and its tendency to smudge the line between life and work, is similarly out-of-step with the A-list. But does it take a personal toll on him? “Well, yes,” he says, smile fading for the first time. “There’s a responsibility that one can take on when using real people who are perhaps struggling. I have sometimes adopted a sort of guardian position with my actors. I couldn’t do it any other way. Also, I am drawn to ...” He narrows his eyes. “The word isn’t ‘dark’. But let’s say ‘alternative’ lifestyles. I find myself getting in a little too deep on a personal level. I’ve had addiction problems throughout my life.” Baker is open about having been hooked on heroin in his 20s. “I will never go back to opiates because that would be suicide,” he says. “But I have found myself in places that I didn’t think I would be, in my 40s and 50s. Sometimes I’ll think, ‘Why am I partying like this?’ It’ll be because I’ve gone into a world that I probably wouldn’t be in were I not interested in covering it in a movie. Or I’m finding it romantic for whatever reason.” Can he maintain a distance in those moments? “There is distance, yes, because I’m there on more of an observational level. But I am participating.” He has a rethink: “So, I guess there’s not that much distance. That can be scary, and I have to watch myself.” Although the film industry is a notoriously dangerous place for anyone with those appetites, Baker claims not to have experienced that side of Hollywood. “It seems to be extremely clean these days. But I’m so indie, I’m outside all that. A lot of my peers – and I’m not slamming them here – are pretty straight-edge. There are a lot of comic-book nerds making movies!” I ask whether he is now clean, and he glances away. The smile is back but it is rueful now rather than carefree. “Um, I’m not,” he says at last. “No, I’m not. I was clean for seven years, and then I realised my drug of choice was opiates, so I started being OK with doing other stuff. It comes and goes. There’s a staple of weed, obviously, which has been more or less normalised in the US. But there’s always the partaking of other, um, party substances. And, uh, that’s where I’ll leave that.” He says this without a trace of defensiveness, but rather in a sweet and conscientious tone, as if placing a fragile object out of harm’s way, or turning his U-rated face away from the X-rated world. • Anora is in UK cinemas from 1 November."

        "Auteur": "Séamas O’Reilly",
        "Date": "2024-04-21",
        "Texte": "I am beset by shrapnel. Pawns fly through the air like exploded balcony segments, rooks plink and plonk off the floor and embed themselves deep within the recesses of our home. My five-year-old son stands above the debris, glowering like Godzilla. He has upended the board again following a defeat to his persistent aggressor. Me. Chess pieces travel fast, so everything else you might wish to offer at this juncture – remonstration, comfort, a stern word, or a hug – must be put on hold while you chase down the disjecta membra in the tiny window of time in which they continue to live in this dimension. For those few seconds they will be visible, found rotating slowly under tables and couches, still energised by the explosion that’s just rent them from their grid. After that they’ll become mere memories, popping back into existence one by one over the next few weeks, in plant pots, slippers and, basically, anywhere you’re looking for something else. The side benefit of this chore is it allows him to cool down as we return the pieces to their right place, and speak about what’s just happened. Michael Jordan once said, ‘Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser.’ Well, he’d have loved my son, one of the worst losers in all of Christendom. He – my son, not Michael Jordan – is still teaching me chess and, I should stress, beating me most of the time. Having never played chess before about six weeks ago, I suddenly find myself wanting to play constantly, and we have dozens of games each week. I win about one game in three, and 50% of those occasions results in us picking up the pieces afterwards. He gets it from his mother, who has never given up in any game or argument since I’ve known her. If I lose at, say, tenpin bowling, the pain dissolves from my brain like vapour within milliseconds of defeat. My wife, on the other hand, will immediately begin drafting a strongly worded email titled ‘Justice?!?’ to Sheikh Talal Mohammed Al-Sabah, president of the International Bowling Federation. I generally find if I’m good at something, I don’t mind losing, because I enjoy the sport of it. If I’m not good at something, I simply couldn’t care less. There may be a harrowing psychological process at play inside my brain. Some infinite capacity for emotional repression, perhaps, or a psychopathic propensity for wiping failure from my mind. It’s served me well through the many disappointments of my life, and I now face having to counsel my son through his own. I say nothing, choosing instead the path of example. We reset the board. His face is pursed and sour. I tell myself maybe I’ll go easy on him, but then I see a killer route to his queen. I can’t be letting him away with that, I think. He needs to learn. Before I’ve even withdrawn my hand, his rook has swooped for my undefended king, ending the game. He laughs. I feel a hotness in my throat and draw a blank as I think who I could send an email to. His eyes fill with glee, coaxing me to join him on the dark side. All equanimity is lost. I grab the board with both hands.

        "Titre": "Friday briefing: Why Biden and Starmer are preparing to let Ukraine use western missiles deep inside Russia",
        "Auteur": "Archie Bland",
        "Date": "2024-09-13",
        "Texte": "Good morning. Keir Starmer’s visit with Joe Biden at the White House this afternoon is undoubtedly the most high-profile meeting with a foreign leader of his premiership so far – but for today, at least, the overwhelming focus is on one issue: the war in Ukraine. At stake, after a week of intense diplomatic choreography between the two sides, is an agreement reported by the Guardian on Wednesday to lift restrictions on Ukraine’s use of western-supplied long-range missiles to attack targets deep inside Russia. The gravity of finalising that decision was underlined by comments from Vladimir Putin yesterday: any such move, he said, “would mean that Nato countries, the US, European countries, are at war with Russia”. So how serious is that risk – and why are Ukraine’s allies now ready to supply these missiles after months of lobbying from Kyiv? For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, about what’s changed – and what it could mean for the course of the war. PS: I’m off for a few weeks now, so Nimo will be taking the lead from Monday. See you in October, and here are the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war | Israel has bombed a UN school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza, killing at least 18 people, including the shelter manager and five other Unrwa staff. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, called the attack “totally unacceptable” and said it broke international laws. Health policy | Plans to ban junk food ads and to stop children buying high-caffeine energy drinks are among radical public health measures being drawn up to prevent illness and ease pressure on the NHS. Ministers are also considering enhanced powers for councils to block the development of fast food outlets near schools to tackle obesity. Conservatives | Frank Hester gave the Conservatives a further £5m just before the election, according to data from the Electoral Commission, despite the party coming under pressure over his remarks about Diane Abbott that were widely condemned as racist. Assisted dying | A citizens’ jury has overwhelmingly backed the legalisation of assisted dying for terminally ill people after hearing from experts over a period of eight weeks. Twenty out of 28 jurors based in England agreed the law should be changed, with seven disagreeing and one person saying they were undecided. SpaceX | Two astronauts have completed the first commercial spacewalk and tested slimmed-down spacesuits designed by SpaceX, in one of the boldest attempts yet to push the boundaries of privately funded spaceflight. In depth: ‘This is a change that could take the war to Russia in a meaningful way’ There will be no press conference after Biden and Starmer meet today, and no announcement of any change to how Storm Shadow missiles can be used. “It’s being billed as a broad strategic discussion,” Dan Sabbagh said, shortly before joining a flight to Washington with Starmer and foreign secretary David Lammy. “It’s likely that the first explicit sign we’ll have of any change is a loud ‘bang’.” The reticence about the change that now appears close to being signed off is one piece of evidence for how sensitive a subject this is. “Ukraine has been desperate for this to happen for a long time,” Dan said. “But the White House has been grappling with whether it’s an escalatory move. Make no mistake: what you’re talking about here is a change that could take the war to Russia in a meaningful way.” *** What are Storm Shadow missiles, and why does Ukraine want them? Storm Shadow missiles can hit targets up to 250km from their launch site – meaning that they could strike well within Russian territory. They are powerful enough to penetrate bunkers and ammunition stores and damage airfields, and they can be precisely targeted. They were developed in an Anglo-French collaboration, and manufactured by a joint venture which also involves Italy – and using components supplied by the US. All four countries would have to sign off on any change to the conditions attached to their use, even if they are not the direct suppliers themselves. The missiles in question are expected to be supplied by Britain and France, not the US – but the New York Times reports that a decision could follow about the comparable US ATACMS missiles in the coming weeks. Ukraine already has Storm Shadow – but it is only permitted to use the missiles within its own territory. Kyiv has been lobbying for months for that to change so that it can direct them at targets on Russian soil, arguing that it is being severely hampered in its efforts to defend itself against regular missile and glide bomb attacks launched from within Russia. While it does have drones and cruise missiles that can strike within Russia, it doesn’t have anything like enough of them to make a significant impact – and they are often intercepted. “There is an acknowledgment in Ukraine that they aren’t going to win by slogging it out on the eastern front,” Dan said. “But they believe they have success when they are innovative, and they think they could use these weapons to make Putin think again.” *** Why are the US and UK ready to give the go-ahead now? Throughout the war, the US and its allies have sought to strike a balance between giving Ukraine the weapons it needs to defend itself – while avoiding any move that could be viewed as a provocation, and lead to direct involvement in the war. But it appears that Kyiv’s lobbying has swayed western diplomats. “Everyone in the west is very careful about getting out of step with the Americans,” Dan said. “But while the US has been reluctant, the British have been trying to be a bridge between Washington and Kyiv.” Over the last week, he noted, the choreography between the US and UK has been striking – with defence ministers talking to Volodymyr Zelenskiy last Friday, then CIA chief Bill Burns at a joint event with MI6 chief Richard Moore on Saturday, then US secretary of state Anthony Blinken and Lammy’s trip to see Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Wednesday (pictured above). “We don’t know definitively what the order of the discussions was, because nobody wants the Russians to know exactly what’s going on,” he added. “But it looks like everyone was waiting for Biden, and now the US is onboard, it’s essentially a done deal.” Some of the factors in that change: the pressure Ukraine is facing on the frontline, and fears of a very difficult winter ahead; Ukraine’s surprising cross-border incursion, which has reframed thinking on the use of weapons on Russian soil and acted as a reminder that Ukraine is at its most effective when it is changing the dynamic of the conflict; and the news that Russia has been furnished with a new batch of deadly ballistic missiles by Iran. The Ukrainian incursion “helped with the argument that they can force the Russians into talks by hitting them where it hurts,” Dan said. “But the Russians are starting to recover their position in Kursk now, and there is a need to change the focus again.” The Iranian missiles, meanwhile, may be as important as a pretext as for their battlefield impact. “It’s a bit of both, but I would slightly lean towards saying that it’s diplomatic cover for allowing the use of Storm Shadow in Russia,” Dan said. David Lammy was at pains to blame Putin for any change in the battlefield calculus: “The escalator here is Putin,” he said. “Putin has escalated with the shipment of missiles from Iran.” Starmer struck a similar note after Putin’s threat of direct war yesterday: “Russia can end this conflict straight away. Ukraine has the right to self-defence.” *** What are the benefits and risks of allowing Storm Shadow to be used within Russia? The message from the west, Dan said, has been that Ukraine needs to give a detailed plan of how the weapons would be used, and what the limits on their deployment would be. “They have said that if there’s a clear rationale for why it would be useful, maybe they can buy into it.” In August, Politico reported that Ukrainian officials visiting Washington would present a list of long-range targets within Russia that could be hit. While the White House has argued that Russia has been moving key assets out of range, it now appears to have been persuaded that enough meaningful targets are available to have an impact. The Nato allies may also have been emboldened by a pattern: when Putin’s red lines on operations within Russia have been crossed previously, he has not escalated the conflict. On the other hand, permitting the use of Storm Shadow would mean allowing the use of western weapons deeper into Russian territory than ever before. And there is an inherent tension in how Ukraine believes the weapons can be effective: by degrading Russia’s ability to strike against targets in Ukraine, yes, but also by making the toll of the war more acute within Russia for its own sake. “However many men Russia loses while it makes progress on the frontline, there is very little political cost to Putin,” Dan said. “So the question is what would make him pay attention.” Part of that is making ordinary Russians fearful of the impact. But doing that without causing a dangerous escalation is a narrow tightrope to walk. “The theory would be that you lean very hard into aiming at military targets well within Russia, and hope that that ripples into how people in Moscow feel about the war,” Dan said. “But if there’s a strike that has civilian casualties, say, that is potentially a big problem for the west. And whereas with a drone strike on a remote airbase it can be deniable that there was any western assistance, you can’t mistake a big boom from a Storm Shadow. So you would hope that they will deployed in a very careful way.” What else we’ve been reading Tom Burgis’ long read about the decade-long legal saga that saw three oligarchs from the former Soviet Union ultimately triumph over the UK’s Serious Fraud Office is an epic piece of reporting, and a brilliantly told, deeply alarming story.

        "Titre": "Let us show Putin we have ability to hit targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine urges west",
        "Auteur": "Dan Sabbagh Kyiv",
        "Date": "2024-08-24",
        "Texte": "Ukraine wants permission from the west to use long-range Storm Shadow missiles to destroy targets deep inside Russia, believing this could force Moscow into negotiating an end to the fighting. Senior figures in Kyiv have suggested that using the Anglo-French weapons in a “demonstration attack” will show the Kremlin that military sites near the capital itself could be vulnerable to direct strikes. The thinking, according to a senior government official, is that Russia will consider negotiating only if it believes Ukraine had the ability “to threaten Moscow and St Petersburg”. This is a high-risk strategy, however, and does not so far have the support of the US. Ukraine has been lobbying for months to be allowed to use Storm Shadow against targets inside Russia, but with little success. Nevertheless, as its army struggles on the eastern front, there is a growing belief that its best hope lies in counter-attack. On Saturday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking on the country’s independence day, said Kyiv had no choice but to retaliate against Russia’s full-scale invasion, launched “913 days ago” in February 2022 – and in particular against Moscow’s use of aerial bombs and ballistic missiles against civilians. “Our enemy will also know what the Ukrainian retaliation means,” the president said. “Worthy, symmetrical and long-range. They will know that, sooner or later, a Ukrainian response will reach any point in the Russian Federation that is a source of danger to the life of our state and our people.” Kyiv and other major cities in Ukraine are routinely targeted by Russian missiles and drones. This week, Oleksandr Syrskyi, the chief of the country’s military, said that since the start of the year, Moscow had attacked Ukraine with 9,590 missiles and 13,997 drones, hitting 6,203 civilian targets and 5,676 military ones. Earlier this month, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk province and now claims control of 1,250 sq km (483 square miles) of Russian territory, though its pace of advance slowed last week. At the same time, Kyiv’s forces have been losing ground near Pokrovsk in the Donbas, where the Russian invaders are now within seven miles of the city, which is a key road and rail hub. Storm Shadow missiles were developed primarily by an Anglo-French collaboration and are made by European joint venture MBDA, which also has an Italian partner. But because some of its components are supplied by the US, the White House also has to agree to its use inside Russia. It has so far refused to do so, fearing an escalation of the conflict. Zelenskiy has argued that the aftermath of Ukraine’s incursion into Russia shows that Kremlin warnings about red lines are exaggerated. Moscow has largely downplayed the attack: leaders barely refer to it in public and describe their response as a “counter-terrorism operation”. US officials told news website Politico that they believed Storm Shadow and other long-range missiles might not be accurate enough over great distances, and that the Russian jet fighters that launched glide bombs into Ukrainian frontline areas were largely based out of range of the missiles, as a precaution. Ukraine also launched a daring series of drone attacks into Russia last week, including an attack on Moscow on Wednesday and on the Marinovka airbase near Volvograd on Thursday, where Su-34 and Su-35 jets that have bombed Ukraine have been based. Sources in Kyiv said drone operations could cost “as little as $1m a time”, and hoped they could destroy some of Russia’s estimated 300 combat aircraft in an attempt to reduce the number of attacks from glide bombs. Estimates vary but a single Su-34 or Su-35 plane may cost as much as $50m. Although it can be argued that the drone attacks are a substitute, one strand of thinking in Kyiv is that by showing Russia it can strike deep inside the country with missiles, it could prompt a reassessment in the Kremlin. However, few believe President Vladimir Putin is interested in calling a halt. John Foreman, a former UK defence attache to Russia and Ukraine, said Kyiv “should not get sucked into a sideshow” by fixating on possible use of Storm Shadow and should instead focus on defending the Donbas. Russia is considered to believe it can break Ukraine though attrition, and is estimated by Kyiv to have about 600,000 troops inside the country. Capturing Pokrovsk in the Donbas ahead of the US presidential election in November would be designed to demonstrate to a new occupant of the White House that Ukraine was fighting a losing battle. Ukraine is believed to have been given the export version of Storm Shadow (known as Scalp in France) by London and Paris. These missiles have a range of about 190 miles, though both the UK and France have domestic versions with a range double that. Moscow lies about 300 miles from Ukraine’s northern border. It is reported that the UK had not applied formally to the US for permission to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow inside Russia. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on this, and instead repeated previous statements about the UK believing Ukraine has a “clear right of self-defence”. Earlier, prime minister Keir Starmer said the UK would back Ukraine “today and always” as he marked the 33rd anniversary of the country’s independence from the former Soviet Union. “We are with you for as long as it takes,” he added. Russia and Ukraine also exchanged more than 100 prisoners of war. Ukraine said on Saturday that the 115 servicemen who were freed were conscripts, many of whom were taken prisoner in the first months of the invasion. About 50 soldiers captured at the steelworks in Mariupol were also included. The Russian defence ministry said the 115 Russian soldiers had been captured in the Kursk region where Ukrainian forces launched their surprise offensive two weeks ago. The ministry said the soldiers were currently in Belarus, but would be taken to Russia for medical treatment."

        "Titre": "I’d hate to be learning English again. Apostrophes are a nightmare | Adrian Chiles",

        "Texte": "The mice’s nest was under the floorboards. The geese’s pond was smelly. There, I’ve done it. I’ve put two words, possessives I have never used and will never use again, into sentences. These were two of 10 awkward possessives that my friend’s daughter had been tasked with putting into sentences. Men’s and ladies’ were on the list too. My friend asked how she might go about explaining the rules behind these apostrophe positions to her nine-year-old. I’m afraid I couldn’t be of much assistance. Rather her than me. The exercise was almost triggering for me. I hated doing these things with my daughters when they were at primary school. This was about the only homework they were ever set – learn how to spell these words and put them into sentences. The purpose is obvious. I get that teaching English spelling is a nightmare and putting a word into a sentence shows that you know what it means, and hopefully helps you remember how to spell it. But, oh Lord, the agonising, circuitous routes around words you’d have to find to construct a bloody sentence. I found a list of words selected to teach year 5s (or should that be 5’s? Don’t ask me) how to deal with words ending in -ance and -ancy. Tolerance is one of them. OK, fine, it would be easier to use “tolerant” than “tolerance” in a sentence a nine-year-old might make sense of, but we’ll come up with something. As for relevancy, dominancy and abundancy, though, I’ll be honest, I’m struggling. I’ve never in my life used the first two. And anyway, aren’t you better off using relevance, dominance or abundance? Don’t they mean the same? I feel a rising sense of panic. Michael Gove celebrated the dominancy of his theories on teaching, dismissing complaints at the limited relevancy of the stupid words. Will that do? Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist"
